The Supreme Subject 

I worship Thee, sweet Will of God! 

And all Thy ways adore; 
And every day I live, I seem 

To love Thee more and more. 

" Man's weakness, wahing upon God, 
Its end can never miss, 
For men on earth no work can do 
More angel-like than this. 

" Ride on, ride on triumphantly, 
Thou glorious Will, ride on! 
Fa'th's pilgrim sons behind T.-iee takfe 
The road that Thou hast gone. 

" He always wins who sides with God, 
To him no chance is lost; 
God's Will is sweetest to him when 
It triumphs at his cost. 

** 111, that He blesses, is our good, 
And unblest good is ill; 
And all is right that seems most wrong, 
If it be His sweet Will." 

F. W. Faber. 

GOD'S PERFECT WILL 

PROLOGUE 

THE SUPREME SUBJECT 

There is no phrase more often in use 
in Christian thought and speech than that 
of "The Will of God." It constantly 
recurs in our reading of Scripture; our 
hymns are very many of them concerned 
with it; and in prayer we give utterance 
to it again and again. 

This familiarity has in some measure 
robbed us of a keen sense of its vital im- 
portance. Its meaning is all too little 
realized. In common with many of the 
most sacred things, it has largely become 
a kind of fetish that is worshiped because 

TI 

God's Perfect Will 

it has a sound of piety; while the fact 
that it is the supreme subject of revela- 
tion, and the one and only abiding law of 
life, is forgotten. Notions that are false 
in themselves, and, therefore, pernicious 
in their effects, are held concerning it. 
These are not the result of thought, but 
rather of the lack of thought. There are 
many who imagine that the Will of God 
is something apart from human interests, 
to which men are to be resigned whenever 
they happen to be brought into contact 
with it. Frances Ridley Havergal said 
that " there is always a sigh of regret in 
resignation." This is perfectly true; and 
that conception of the Will of God which 
looks upon it as a Divine interference to 
which we are to be resigned, is evil in its 
effects. How many there are who only 
think of their relation to the Will of God 
in times of sorrow and trial. They are 

12 

The Supreme Subject 

perfectly sincere, therefore, when they 
singâ€” 

" If Thou shouldst call me to resign 
What most I prized â€” it ne'er was mine; 
I only yield Thee what was Thine: 
Thy will be done! " 

Yet the very words of the hymn reveal 
the fact that the singer does not truly 
understand the safety, the blessedness, 
the delight of dwelling in the circle of the 
Divine Will. 

The one and only law of life that sets 
a man free from all the forces that blight 
and destroy is the Will of God. Show 
me a man who lives for one day wholly, 
utterly, in word and thought and deed in 
the Will of God, and I will show you a 
man who is antedating heaven, and who 
for that day reaches the plane of life 
which is at once broadest, freest, and 
gladdest. 

13 

God's Perfect Will 

The word of God is given to man not 
that he may have a correct theory, but 
that he may have the truth. Truth is a 
sanctifying force, and a man holds the 
truth only when he is held by the truth. 
When truth possesses a man, all its glory 
and beauty are manifested through his 
life and character. The truth the Bible 
reveals is the Will of God for man. 
Sanctification by truth is the bringing of 
man into the Will of God. 

" The means of grace " are means to 
an end, that end being the realization of 
the Will of God. Every one of them 
tends to that issue. 

" The hope of glory " is the hope that 
ultimately the Will of God will be done 
upon the earth as in the heaven, or that 
the spirit of man, passing into the heav- 
enly state, shall realize all the full bless- 
edness of that Will. 
14 

The Supreme Subject 

All prayer lies within the two petitions 
of the pattern prayer the Master taught 
His disciples: *' Thy kingdom come; 
Thy will be done." There is no prayer 
beyond that. It may be divided into sen- 
tences and syllables, and made to fit the 
necessity of the hour; but when prayer 
moves the heart of God, it is because it is 
confined within that compass. 

Allow your imagination to carry you 
back to the past ages. Amid the silences 
of that immeasurable eternity you are 
conscious of perfect peace, perfect happi- 
ness, perfect love. The explanation is to 
be found in the fact that the Will of God 
was perfectly done. None can declare 
the genesis of evil, but its nature is clearly 
known â€” it is rebellion against the Will of 
God. The mystery of how that first came 
to be, is absolutely inscrutable, but the 
fact is established beyond question. 
IS 

God's Perfect Will 

We are but infinitesimal portions of 
the universe of God, but the being of the 
smallest particle of created things is con- 
ditioned in His Will, and its success or 
failure depends upon its realization of, or 
failure to realize, that Will. The su- 
preme subject in every life, then, is that 
His Will should be discovered and 
obeyed. 

Today we are hearing much on every 
hand on such subjects as the filling of the 
Spirit, holiness, power for service. This 
is cause for gratitude; but, after all, these 
are means to an end, and that end is the 
Will of God. A Spirit-filled man is a 
most glorious being; but by that condi- 
tion he has not reached the goal, he has 
only become equipped for fulfilling the 
essential of his life. Holiness is to be 
sought and found. A holy man is not, 
1:6 

The Supreme Subject 

however, to rest in his hoHness. It is 
health for perpetual obedience. Power 
for service is a great blessing, but service 
as response to the Will of God is the su- 
preme matter. 

The most vital consideration for every 
human life is as to whether we are, and 
do, that which accords with the Will of 
God. 

John declares (1 John 2:17) that the 
doing of the Will of God is the condition 
of permanence amid the perishing and 
passing of the world. We are conscious 
that all around is perishing; yea, and we 
ourselves, as to bodily powers, pass away. 
We are also conscious of a passionate de- 
sire for permanence. The possessive pro- 
nouns are at once a revelation of that de- 
sire, and a confession of weakness. " My 
house "; and it is gone! " My child "; 
17 

God*s Perfect Will 

and it is dead! There is permanence 
only in the Will of God, and there only 
can we fully use the possessive pron^^un, 
" My Lord and my God." 

1:8 

The Message ot the Old Testament 

" When people read, ' The law came by- 
Moses, but grace and truth by Christ,' do 
they suppose it means that the law was 
ungracious and uritrue? The law was given 
for a foundation; the grace (or mercy) and 
truth for fulfiknent; â€” the whole forming one 
glorious Trinity of judgment, mercy, and 
truth. And if people would but read the text 
of their Bibles with heartier purpose of under- 
standing it, instead of superstitiously, they 
would see that throughout the parts which they 
are intended to make most personally their own 
(the Psalms), it is always the Law which is 
spoken of with chief joy. The Psalms respect- 
ing mercy are often sorrowful, as in thought of 
what it cost; but those respecting the law are 
always lull of delight. David cannot contain 
himself for joy in thinking of it â€” he is never 
weary of its praise: â€” * How love I Thy law! 
it is my meditation all the day. Thy testi- 
monies are my delight and my counselors; 
sweeter, also, than honey and the honeycomb.' " 
RusKiN ("Modern Painters"). 

THE MESSAGE OF THE OLD 
TESTAMENT 

The Old Testament declares the be- 
ginnings of created things, and gives us 
the history of the race from Creation to 
four hundred years prior to the coming 
of Christ. The underlying current of 
truth running through all its pages has 
to do with the one subject of the Will of 
God. Let the panorama of life move 
before the eye of the mind. Note well 
its darkness and light, its places of agony 
and of rapture. Mark the deeds which 
appall, and the heroisms which thrill. 
From beginning to end, the character of 
the picture is determined by the relation 

21 

God's Perfect Will 

of men or nations to the Will of God. 
This is the great message of the Old 
Testament, that all the rivers that have 
made sad the life of man have had their 
source in his departure from that " good 
and perfect and acceptable Will of 
God "; and all the streams that have 
made glad the probationary pilgrimage 
of individuals, or the cities wherein men 
have dwelt, have sprung from the throne 
of God, which is the seat of His govern- 
ment. 

The historical books tell the story of 
the wandering of man from God again 
and again, and show how all such wan- 
dering issued in disaster. They also re- 
veal the one unending purpose of God to 
bring man back into harmony with that 
Will. The methods were many; the in- 
tention one. The devout of all the ages 
breathed, if not in words yet in spirit, the 

22 

The Message of the Old Testament 

same prayer â€” " Thy kingdom come; Thy 
will be done." The very essence of evil 
lay in the rebellion of the human heart 
against that Kingdom and that Will. 

The devotional books are all occupied 
with the same theme. The songs find 
their keynote in the kinghood and throne 
of God. *' The Lord reigneth." *' Thy 
throne, O God, is for ever and ever." 
These and kindred phrases tell the char- 
acter of the music. When the song is of 
human experience at its best, it is ever 
of the joy and peace to be found in the 
law of God. " Oh how I love Thy 
law." " Thy commandment is exceeding 
broad." When the music becomes a 
dirge, it is because in individual or na- 
tional life God has been forgotten. 
" When I kept silence my bones waxed 
old through my roaring." " The fool 
hath said in his heart, There is no 
23 

God's Perfect Will 

God." Or, if you read aright the pray- 
ers, they are all part and parcel of the 
aspiration of man, after a realization of 
the Divine purpose and pathway. " Teach 
me to do Thy will, O God." "Make 
haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation." 
The prophetic books have a like sig- 
nificance. The burden that oppressed 
these men, until they delivered them- 
selves in words of flaming fire, was a 
burden of Di^'^ne judgment and govern- 
ment. Natiotis that had forgotten God 
were called back to allegiance. Nations 
persisting in their w^aywardness were 
told of their doom. The perpetual cry 
of the prophets was, " Let the wicked 
forsake his way, and the unrighteous 
man his thoughts, and let him return to 
the Lord." These men spake as the 
oracles of God, without fear or faltering, 
and their message was ever a '* Thus 
24 

The Message of the Old Testament 

saith the Lord "; and the secret of their 
daring and devotion the fact that each 
could say, " The Lord, before Whom I 
stand." 

Or if we take another method of con- 
sidering the message of the Old Testa- 
ment, we shall arrive at the same result. 
Range before your vision all the hosts of 
the men of all the centuries. They stand 
now in imagination like a long chain of 
hills stretching far back to the first man 
Adam â€” " which was the son of God." 
Such an outlook at once reveals certain 
men that stand out from among their fel- 
lows, their heads raised above them, 
capped with the pure snows, and catch- 
ing first and keeping last the light of the 
sun. Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abra- 
ham, Moses, David, Elijah, and others 
that space forbids our naming. What 
makes the difiference between these and 
25 

God's Perfect Will 

their fellows? In every case the measure 
of their superiority is the measure of 
their understanding of, and obedience to, 
the Will of God. 

Adam erect, is so because he fulfills 
the purpose of God. Abel received, is so 
because he lives a life God-centered rather 
than self-centered. Enoch's distinction is 
revealed in his brief biography, " Enoch 
walked with God." Noah, also, amid the 
most appalling corruption, believed God, 
and was saved in the works of obedience 
that grew out of his faith. Abraham be- 
came the father of the Faithful because 
he went out, not knowing whither he 
went, confident alone in the wisdom and 
Tightness of the word of God. Moses, 
having himself learned to wait for the 
guidance of God, gave the world a code 
of ethics which remains the foundation 
of morality to this day, because it was 
26 

The Message of the Old Testament 

first written with the finger of God. 
David's memory is revered more for his 
harp than his crown, and that because, 
through it, he sang of the law of his God. 
EHjah still stands as the type of rough, 
magnificent character, because he was 
the messenger of law to an apostate 
age. These were all great, inasmuch as 
they abode in the Will of God; and the 
things that smirch the escutcheon of 
each, were of the nature of disobedience 
or wandering from the Divinely-marked 
pathway. 

Thus, from the song of new-born earth 
to the fiery warning of Malachi, the Old 
Testament brings us face to face with 
the supreme subject. 

The Message of the New Testament 

Thou wert the end, the blessed rule 

Of Jesu's toils and tears; 
Thou wert the passion of His heart, 

Those three-and-thirty years." 

F. W. Faber. 

THE MESSAGE OF THE NEW 
TESTAMENT 

II 

If the Old Testament is occupied with 
the Will of God as its supreme subject, 
the New Testament is in all its parts an 
unveiling and exposition thereof, both as 
to nature and possibility. 

For the purpose of a general survey, 
we shall divide the New Testament into 
its three principal sections of historic, 
didactic, and prophetic books. These in- 
clude â€” 

1. Historic. The Gospels and Acts. 

2. Didactic. The Epistles. 

3. Prophetic. The Revelation. 

In the first we have the story of the life 
31 

God's Perfect Will 

of Jesus, and the first chapter in His 
larger life resulting from the work He 
accomplished. Also His teaching, con- 
taining unified truth, which became clear 
in the subsequent light of the Spirit's 
teaching. 

â€¢In the second we have the unfolding 
of truth for the individual believer and 
the Church, by men indwelt and inspired 
by the Holy Spirit. 

In the third we have, for the most part, 
visions of the closing scenes of the pres- 
ent dispensation and the accomplishment 
of Divine purposes through Divine 
power. 

In all of these the subject is the Will of 
God. 

The life of Jesus realized it, and His 
teaching declared its nature and neces- 
sity. The men whose doings are recorded 
in the Acts lived wholly in, and only for, 
32 

The Message of the New Testament 

that Will. The consummation of all is 
the triumph of righteousness and love by 
the complete submission of humanity 
thereto. 

I. Historic. 

Taking these in the order named, we 
come first to the historic books. The 
roots of the New are in the Old. We 
therefore go back to the Psalms for the 
keynote of these books. " Sacrifice and 
oflfering Thou hast no delight in; mine 
ears hast Thou opened: burnt oflfering 
and sin oflfering hast Thou not required. 
Then said I, Lo, I am come; in the roll 
of the book it is written of me: I de- 
light to do Thy zvill, O my God." None 
will deny that this belongs to the New 
Testament, for we are agreed that these 
words had their perfect fulfillment in the 
person and experience of Jesus. 

God's Perfect Will 

Underlying everything in the fourfold 
Gospel of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and 
John is the perpetual sounding of this 
note of perfect music, " I delight to do 
Thy will, O my God." In the life of 
Jesus it was the reason for all He did, 
and the inspiration of all He said. 
Whether living as a boy in His mother's 
home, or working as a man at His trade 
of carpenter; whether going to the Jor- 
dan for baptism, or to the wilderness for 
temptation; whether preaching to the 
crowds, or working wonders of love 
among the needy â€” His life was perpetu- 
ally filled with delight in the Will of God. 
Once only in the history of the human 
race has there been a life true to the Di- 
vine ideal. That was the life of Jesus. 

When His mother found Him in the 
Temple, He said to her, " Wist ye not 
that T must be in My Father's house? " 
34 

The Message of the New Testament 

(Luke 2:49). His Father's Will for 
Him was that He should be a disciple 
among the teachers of His people, and 
that was the explanation of His tarrying 
behind at Jerusalem. 

When He faced and overcame tempta- 
tion, He did so in the strength of the fact 
that " Man shall not live by bread alone, 
but by every word that proceedeth out 
of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). 
And when His disciples urged Him upon 
one occasion to eat, He replied, " My 
meat is to do the will of Him that sent 
Me, and to accomplish His work " (John 
4:34). He needed bread; but the su- 
preme necessity was that He should do 
the Will of God. That was the suste- 
nance of His deepest life. In reply to the 
criticisms of His enemies. He dared to 
say, " He that sent Me is with Me; He 
hath not left Me alone; for I do always 
35 

God's Perfect Will 

the things that are pleasing to Him " 
(John 8:29). 

The Will of God was equally the sum 
and substance of His teaching. Indeed, 
it is impossible to separate between His 
teuching and Himself. He said, " I am 
thÂ«^ Truth," not " I teach the truth." 
When I see what He is, I know what He 
is going to teach me; and when I hear 
what He teaches, I know what He is. 

His Sermon on the Mount is the 
Magna Charta of the Will of God, the 
most wonderful words that ever fell on 
the ears of man. 

'' Happy! " (Matthew 5:3). That is the 
first of them, and it is the keynote of all 
that follows, declaring immediately what 
is the Will of God for man. In solemn 
words He sets the doing of that Will at 
the very wicket of the kingdom, not as 
pass-word â€” there are no words that will 
36 

The Message of the New Testament 

pass men into heaven's kingdom â€” but as 
the condition upon which men may enter: 
'' Not every one that saith unto Me, 
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom 
of heaven; but he that doeth the will of 
My Father which is in heaven" (Matt, 
7:21 ); and closes with that most won- 
derful claim for Himself, " Every one, 
therefore, which heareth these words of 
Mine, and doeth them, shall be likened 
unto a wise man, which built his house 
upon the rock" (Matthew 7:24). 

Thus the Gospels unveil the perfect 
ideal in life and teaching of the man 
who does the Will of God. 

The Acts of the Apostles opens with 
the significant words, " The former trea- 
tise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all 
that Jesus began both to do and to 
teach" (Acts i. i). The reference Luke 
makes to a " former treatise " is of 

God's Perfect Will 

course to his Gospel, and he declares 
\hat Gospel to be the story of begin- 
nings only. The inference is that the 
second treatise is a story of continuation; 
and this we discover to be so as we read, 
for the history is one of the doing of the 
Will of God by Spirit-filled men. What 
men they were! They moved the world! 
Study that wonderful fifth chapter. What 
a state the priests were in! Nothing so 
troubles the priest as to come in contact 
with men doing the Will of God. They 
said to Peter and the rest, " We straitly 
charged you not to teach in this name: 
and behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with 
your teaching" (Acts 5:28). There is 
no finer testimony to apostolic work on 
record. A mere handful of men had 
filled Jerusalem with their teaching, and 
it was teaching that gripped, for the 
priests continued â€” '* and intend to bring 
38 

The Message of the New Testament 
this Man's blood upon us " (Acts v. 

28). 

In Peter's answer, in a brief sentence 
he reveals the secret of these phenomena 
that so perplexed and baffled the priests, 
''We must obey God!" (Acts 5:29). 
That is the secret. These men shook 
kingdoms to their foundations and 
turned the world upside down, their ene- 
mies being witness; and the reason of 
their success lay in their abandonment to 
the Will of God. 

II. Didactic. 

Turning to the didactic writings, we 
find the same great theme in all. Take 
illustrations from the writings of Peter, 
James, and John. 

I. Peter. " Forasmuch then as Christ 
sufifered in the flesh, arm ye yourselves 
also with the same mind; for he that 
30 

God's Perfect Will 

hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased 
from sin; that ye no longer should live 
the rest of your time in the flesh to the 
lusts of men, but to the will of God" 
(1 Peter 4:1:2). That is Peter's concep- 
tion of the meaning of the Christ-life. 

2. James. '" Go to now, ye that say, 
Today or tomorrow we will go into this 
city, and spend a year there, and trade, 
and get gain: whereas ye know not what 
shall be on the morrow. What is your 
life? For ye are a vapor, that appeareth 
for a little time, and then vanisheth away. 
For that ye ought to say, // the Lord 
zvill, we shall both live^ and do this or 
that" (James 4:13-15). James does 
not deny that we have to make arrange- 
ments for today and tomorrow. He 
insists that concerning them all we should 
say, " If the Lord will." 

3. John. '^'The world passeth away, 

40 

The Message of the New Testament 

and the lust thereof: but he that doeth 
the zvill of God abideth for ever " ( i 
John 2:17). John declares the Will of 
God to be the place of permanence, and 
all outside that Will is doomed to perish. 

From these turn to the Pauline letters, 
and still the theme is the same: " I be- 
seech you therefore, brethren, by the 
mercies of God, to present your bodies 
a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, 
v^hich is your reasonable service. And 
be not fashioned according to this world: 
but be ye transformed by the renewing of 
your mind, that ye may prove what is 
the good and acceptable and perfect will 
of God" (Romans 12:1:2). The apostle's 
object in calling us to surrender our- 
selves is that wr may prove the goodness, 
acceptability, and perfectness of the Will 
of God. 

" For this cause we also, since the day 
41 

God's Perfect Will 

we heard it, do not cease to pray and 
make request for you, that ye may be 
filled with the knozvicdgc of His icill in 
all spiritual wisdom and understanding " 
(Colossians 1:9). That is the burden of his 
prayer â€” not for Colossian believers only, 
but also for all those in whom he was 
interested. 

The distinctive glory of the letter to 
the Hebrews is that it deals with the 
bringing in of " better things " which 
shall make men " perfect in every good 
thing to do His zvill" (Hebrews 13:21). 

Jude looks forward in his doxology to 
that day in which the Church shall be 
presented '' before the presence of His 
glory without blemish in exceeding joy " 
(Jude 24). 

All these writers agree, that the Will 
of God fulfilled in human life is the pur- 
42 

The Message of the New Testament 

pose of Christ in His people, and through 
His people in the world. 

HI. Prophetic. 

Lastly, we turn to the prophetic book 
of the Revelation. Of this there are 
many interpretations, but there are points 
of perfect agreement. To one of these 
we now come. " And the four and 
twenty elders and the four living crea- 
tures fell down and worshiped God that 
sitteth on the throne, saying, Amen; 
Hallelujah. And a voice came forth 
from the throne, saying. Give praise to 
our God, all ye His servants, ye that fear 
Him, the small and the great. And I 
heard as it were the voice of a great mul- 
titude, and as the voice of many waters, 
and as the voice of mighty thunders, say- 
ing. Hallelujah; for the Lord our God. 
43 

God's Perfect Will 

the Almighty, reign eth " (Revelation 19:4- 
6). Differences of opinion exist as to 
the methods by which that glorious con- 
summation is to be reached, but we all 
believe the time is coming when the Lord 
God Omnipotent shall reign and His 
Will be done. "Amen; Hallelujah." 
These words reveal the source of the 
blessedness of that glad day. God on the 
throne, and humanity saying " Amen " 
in consent, and " Hallelujah " in praise. 

We commenced this study in the 
Psalms. Let us return there for a mo- 
ment in conclusion. " Save us, O Lord 
our God, and gather us from among the 
nations, to give thanks unto Thy holy 
name, and to triumph in Thy praise. 
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, 
from everlasting even to everlasting: and 
let all the people say, Amen, Hallelujah " 
(Psalm 106:47, 48, margin). Now read 
44 

The Message of the New Testament 

again the song of the Apocalypse, " And 
the four and twenty elders and the four 
living creatures fell down and wor- 
shipped God that sitteth on the throne, 
saying. Amen; Hallelujah" (Revelation 19:
4). Ransomed and redeemed humanity 
saying " Amen " â€” so be it, to the Will of 
God; and after the Amen, *' Hallelu- 
jah " â€” praise the Lord. 

That is the consummation. The Old 
prays for it; the New predicts and pre- 
pares for it. We may dream dreams of 
its splendor, but no dream can compass 
the reality, it is too great. Humanity, 
in every beating pulse, every fiber of its 
being, every drawing breath, saying 
" Amen " to the Will of God, " Hallelu- 
jah " to His government. 

Thus Old and New, the one Bible, 
declares that the Divine Will is the only 
law of human life that satisfies the heart 
45 

God's Perfect Will 

of God and ensures the well-being of 
man. 

This very fact is that which gives su- 
preme importance to Holy Scripture, and 
should condition all attempts to study it. 
There is, undoubtedly, room for devout 
criticism, study of the question of dates, 
and authorship; and there should ever be 
the widest toleration for different inter- 
pretations of many of the mysteries dealt 
with, which are, after all, beyond the 
possibility of full and final statement. 
To treat the Bible, however, as literature 
merely, or to read it with a view to for- 
mulating certain systems of belief, is to 
fail to realize its highest value, or to 
touch its deepest significance. 

On its every page there is unfolded 

something of the Divine order, method, 

and purpose in the government of man. 

While the chronicles reveal the fault and 

46 

The Message of the New Testament 

failures of sinning men, all through 
there moves the Spirit of God, revealing 
the fact of His Kingship; and in every 
message of Psalmist, Seer, or Prophet, 
there is the unmistakable call to loyalty 
and obedience. 

It is only as this is remembered, and 
the study of the Book is approached 
with sincere desire to discover the pur- 
pose of God in human life, and the laws 
which make that purpose possible of real- 
ization, that the Book answers its high- 
est intention.

** The steps of the way I know not, 

But my Leader I know full well; 
My hand is in His, I fear not â€” 

In the depths of His peace I dwell. 
He knows where He leads; I know not,

My heart is His own; I fear not, 

For the way is my Lord's highway. 

" The hours may seem dark and dreary, 

But His presence my life shall cheer; 
The night may seem sad and weary. 

But I know that my Lord is near. 
One step at a time He shows me, 

And I know that the rest He hides, 
That love may the better show me 

How in safety His mercy guides, 

"I wait, in His will abiding; 

I rejoice, for His strength sustains; 
I trust in His word confiding; 

And of doubt not one trace remains. 
And never comes pain or sadness 
But to hasten the sunlit morn; 
Then grief shall give way to gladness, 
Then never a sigh be born."

A THREEFOLD DEMAND 

III 

In our previous studies we have seen 
that the supreme subject of Scripture is 
the Will of God. As a revelation to man, 
it declares that human life is only per- 
fectly conditioned as it discovers that 
Will, and yields implicit obedience 
thereto. In the present study we shall 
ask certain questions from the standpoint 
of conscious human need. Let it be 
granted that law in some form is a neces- 
sity; that anarchy of individual or social 
being is chaos and confusion; the ques- 
tion at once arises as to the highest and 
best law possible. A rough-and-ready 
division of the mass of men today will 
reveal three classes. 
-SI 

God's Perfect Will 

First, there are those who are the 
slaves of others. Human opinion is the 
test of all their doing and speaking. Con- 
ventionality holds them in an iron grip. 
They will do, or refuse to do, anything 
according to the opinion of some one 
else. The habit of the crowd becomes 
the rule of life. Or it may be that some 
one person is looked to as lawgiver; that 
person being sometimes called priest, at 
others teacher. The craving is for au- 
thority outside one's own personality; 
and this is sought in many ways. 

Then there are those who affect to de- 
spise the opinion of others, and are 
openly and avowedly self-confident. 
They care not what others do, they are 
capable of making their own program, 
conducting their own affairs. These are 
the people who make time-tables for 
themselves and form resolutions and sur- 
52 

A Threefold Demand 

round themselves with a whole sy.stem of 
self-created safety laws. 

Lastly, there are those who decHne to 
be governed by the opinion of others, 
and who have absolutely abandoned at- 
tempting to control themselves by self- 
made programs and regulations, and 
whose whole lives are conditioned in the 
prayer of the Psalmist of old: " Teach 
me to do Thy Will; for Thou art my 
God" (Psa. cxHii. lo). 

The test as to which of these is really 
the highest law of life is to be found 
within the consciousness of man himself. 
There are certain aspirations of the hu- 
man heart which are ever present. They 
may be distorted or dwarfed, but in some 
form they abide as the necessary and 
unalterable desires of human nature. 
The law of life which realizes and satis- 
fies these, to the fullest possible extent, 
53 

God's Perfect Will 

iimst of necessity be the best. These 
aspirations may be summarized under 
three heads â€” Perfection, Pleasure, Per- 
petuity. 

I. Perfection. 

The first aspiration of every human 
life is for Perfection. How strange and 
inexplicable, by the way, is the fear some 
excellent people have of the word. With 
what bated breath, and what aloofness 
of fear, is one often asked if one really 
believes in Christian perfection. And 
yet what else can one believe in who be- 
lieves in Christ? Try other phrases â€” 
Christian imperfection, for instance. 
Will not some one explain that for us? 
Or. if you prefer, take another form of 
the negative â€” imperfect Christianity. 
Alas, yes, there is much of it; but who 
will say they believe in it? Let us have 
done with this unholy fear of a phrase, 
54 

A Threefold Demand 

and at once say that nothing can satisfy 
the deepest demand of our human nature 
except its perfection. It is the common 
passion of the race, often partially real- 
ized and constantly abused, but perpetu- 
ally present. 

Who is there that would not immedi- 
ately secure physical perfection if that 
were possible? To be vigorous, propor- 
tioned, and beautiful, would be a bless- 
ing no sane person would despise. Men- 
tal perfection is much less coveted be- 
cause harder to attain, yet none would 
refuse to make some effort to attain it 
if it were within measurable distance. 
Spiritual perfection is alas most neg- 
lected, probably because it moves on the 
highest plane; yet no person, upon calm 
reflection, would deUberately reject this 
if they were once convinced of its ac- 
cessibility. 

55 

God's Perfect Will 

This, then, is the first demand by 
which we propose to test any law or 
philosophy of life. It must be of such a 
nature as to ensure the ultimate perfec- 
tion of our being, not on one side merely, 
but in its tripartite character of spirit, 
soul, and body. 

II. Pleasure. 

The second demand is for Pleasure. 
This is a perfectly legitimate demand, 
because it comes out of the deepest ne- 
cessities of human nature, and is common 
to men everywhere, under most diversi- 
fied conditions of life. In all ages, in all 
lands, and under all circumstances of 
life, man desires and seeks after happi- 
ness. It is very doubtful if a single ex- 
ception can be found to this rule in the 
ranks of the human family. We occa- 
sionally hear of such a thing as misan- 
56 

A Threefold Demand 

thropy; and some there are who even 
venture to affirm that they have seen a 
misanthrope. Some of us have never 
had such a sorrowful experience, thank 
God! 

There are men who seem to have no 
fellowship with the ordinary pursuits of 
pleasure, and are devoid of humor of a 
certain kind; but it has been discovered 
often that in some hidden and least ex- 
pected place they have had their treasure- 
house of happiness. That it was not of 
the nature of the things that make other 
men happy does not matter for a mo- 
ment. Even if it be granted that there 
are some human beings who are all that 
is intended by the word misanthrope, 
the true facts of their condition are 
quaintly revealed in the saying that they 
are only happy when miserable, for out 
of their discontent they are attempting 
57 

God's Perfect Will 

to minister to the universal craving for 
pleasure. 

Man v^as not made for sorrow. It is, 
we believe, a Divine ministrant of bless- 
ing, and in many cases precedes glad- 
ness; but the transient character of sor- 
row in the purpose of God is marked by 
the glorious promise that He will wipe 
all tears away. The heart of man was 
made for peace, and joy, and love; and 
through all the foolish blundering of 
popular pleasure-seeking, it is after these 
men seek. 

By this also, therefore, we test the 
laws of life that are proposed to us. 
They must secure for us the highest and 
fullest pleasure; not that which is unsub- 
stantial and evanescent, but the deep and 
the abiding; and the law which most per- 
fectly does this is the best, and to it we 
will yield our wholehearted allegiance. 
58 

A Threefold Demand 

III. Perpetuity. 

The last demand is that of Perpetuity. 
Man is everywhere, and at all times, and 
in every way, at war w^ith decay. The 
hatred of death, and the loathing of the 
grave, mark the fact that man has capa- 
city for life, and therefore feels rebellious 
against the faintest suggestion of its ces- 
sation. 

How men strive after perpetuity! The 
search of old for the elixir of life was a 
pathetic proof of this craving; and in 
cases where men have been unable to 
hope for actual continuity of being, they 
have sought to perpetuate their exist- 
ence in the memory of others by writ- 
ings and works, and even by monuments 
erected. 

We cry out for the beyond. Horizons 
are always a menace to our peace. We 
crave the infinite. Deeply conscious of 
59 

God's Perfect Will 

the perishing nature of everything 
around us; seeing the dark sentence, 
*' passing away," writ large upon our 
most valued treasures, and feeling our- 
selves ceaselessly moving through the 
pages of our life's story to the dreaded 
word FINIS â€” we sigh, and sob, and fret, 
and demand some place that passes not; 
some treasure that vanishes not away; 
some secret of being that will enable us 
to say. We abide, masters of death. 

True it is, that thousands of us seem 
to float easily through the days, uncon- 
scious of these cravings, content to drift 
and not to know. Yet this is but false 
seeming. Carefully observe the first or- 
dinary, every-day, matter-of-fact man 
in any crowd in any city, in any land. 
Keep close to him, that you may watch 
him. Presently, in a moment of loneli- 
ness, when the things unseen come near 
60 

A Threefold Demand 

in overwhelming reality, or when he 
faces death and feels it imminent, or 
when some cherished hope is suddenly 
blighted, that man will lift his eyes and 
gaze wistfully toward the future. In 
those eyes shine the light of his true be- 
ing, and the passion for perpetuity is re- 
vealed as being the true and perpetual 
sub-consciousness of his life. 

That law of life which could answer 
that demand, and make man master of 
all the forces of disintegration and de- 
cay, is assuredly the highest and the best; 
and when we find it, to it we will aban- 
don ourselves with whole-hearted devo- 
tion. 

Thus standing within the realm of my 
own being, turning a deaf ear for the 
moment to all the babel of outside voices, 
I hear the speech of my true life, and 
learn its deepest demands; and I sol- 
6i 

God's Perfect Will 

emnly, deliberately, and positively de- 
clare that if the Will of God for man be, 
as the Bible declares it to be, the highest 
philosophy of human life, it must meet 
this threefold demand, and secure to me 
the perfection of my being, the highest 
and abiding pleasure, and that victory 
over the elements of death and decay 
which shall ensure my perpetuity. 

In three subsequent chapters we shall 
endeavor to show that this is exactly 
what the Will of God does, and what 
any other law of life fails to do. In con- 
cluding the present study, it will be suffi- 
dent to summarize the subjects of the 
next three thus: 

I. God's Will is perfect, because by 
Him man was created, and He 
therefore is alone able to make 
such laws as shall ensure man's 
perfection. 

62 

A Threefold Demand 

2. God's Will is perfect, because He is 

love, and Love only can make 
laws for man which will provide 
him with perfect pleasure. 

3. God's Will is perfect, because He is, 

and the Eternal alone can make 
laws which take in all the past, 
present, and future, so as to se- 
cure perpetuity.

Tennyson ("In Memoriam"). 

PROVIDES PERFECTION 

IV 

In considering the threefold demand 
dealt with in the last chapter, we come 
first in order to the demand for perfec- 
tion. The answer of the Will of God to 
that demand may be briefly stated. 

God's Will is perfect, because by 
Him man was created, and He, 
therefore, is alone able to make 
such laws as shall ensure man's 
perfection. 
This is coming down to a statement of 
the simplest kind. We all profess to be- 
lieve that God has given us our being, 
and in a deep conviction of that truth 
lies the reason why we should yield our- 
67 

God's Perfect Will 

selves wholly to His government in order 
that we may attain perfection of being. 

Perhaps it is necessary to emphasize 
this initial fact, for oftentimes the teach- 
er's greatest difficulty is to get men to ac- 
cept the truth of the truth they accept. 
When Daniel, as the interpreter of the 
Divine message to Belshazzar, named the 
sin of that monarch which was about to 
be punished, he did not mention the sins 
of impurity, drunkenness, or sacrilege, 
though of all these he had been guilty. 
He declared the sin which lies at the root 
of all sins, because it has to do with 
man's relation to God â€” " The God in 
Whose hand thy breath is, and Whose 
are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified " 
(Daniel 5:23). In that charge we are 
reminded of the fact that our very being, 
in all its powers and possibiHties, is of 
Divine origin. 

68 

Provides Perfection 

Paul, preaching to the Athenians on 
Mars' Hill, makes the same statement, in 
terms, if possible, more explicit â€” " In 
Him we live, and move, and have our 
being" (Acts 17:28). We are the 
creation of God. Spirit, soul, and body, 
each in its own possibility; and the one 
being, resulting from the union, is the 
result of Divine conception and creation. 
Every human being is a concrete thought 
of God. God therefore knows the po- 
tentiality of each of us, and the line of 
our development, and it is only as we are 
able to discover His Will and obey it, 
that we shall move along the one to the 
full realization of the other. 

The folly of conditioning conduct by 
the thoughts or wishes of other human 
beings is apparent in the light of this 
fact. To the declaration of John that 
*' No man hath seen God at any time " 
69 

God's Perfect Will 

(John i. 1:8), we all agree. Not so 
readily do we assent to the assertion that 
no man hath seen man at any time, yet it 
is equally true. The outward form and 
tone of voice are familiar, but my essen- 
tial friend who tabernacles in the body 
I touch, and conveys his thought through 
the medium of the speech I hear, I have 
never yet seen. No man knows perfectly 
and completely his fellow-man. The 
mother that bore me, the wife of my 
heart, the children of my love, do not 
know me. They are all familiar with 
the sound of my voice, the touch of my 
hand, and the fall of my foot on the stair; 
but all the deeps that lie behind, held for 
ever sacred from the possibility of in- 
trusion, of these they have no final and 
complete knowledge. 

And yet, forsooth, we are perpetually 
in danger of taking our law of life from 
70 

Provides Perfection 

the opinion of some mortal who has no 
adequate knowledge of the perils and 
possibiHties of our complex nature. Oh, 
the folly of it! As well let the black- 
smith repair our watch, or the collier 
tune our harp, as allow man, ignorant 
of the essence and intention of our com- 
plex life, to arrange for its conduct. The 
interference of a human being between 
another and God is an impertinence and a 
blasphemy, whatever the name by which 
the interferer is called, whether it be 
priest, or teacher, or friend. 

Equally foolish is man's attempt to 
govern himself, for it is equally true that 
no man has seen himself, neither does 
any man know himself. The old Greek 
philosopher said his last and best thing 
when he said, '' Man, know thyself," be- 
cause he thus brought man face to face 
with the impossible; and when a man is 
71 

God's Perfect Will 

brought there, he is in the place where it 
is possible for him to acquaint himself 
with God and be at peace. 

In our younger days we imagine that 
we know the possibilities of our being, 
and are able to plan and arrange the 
whole line of progress. The years are 
startling revealers. As they pass, we dis- 
cover new powers for good and evil that 
had lain dormant within, and of which 
we had absolutely no consciousness until 
some crisis aroused and called forth to 
action the sleeping forces. How we 
trembled when we found that there v/as 
the power of murder lying hidden in our 
heart! How we suffered when we came 
to know of a surety that, in spite of all 
our earlier boasting, we too had the mak- 
ing of the traitor within, and might have 
kissed the Master to His death! 

Ah, those days of time-tables, and 
72 

Provides Perfection 

programs, and pledges, and promises, 
when we proudly said we were masters 
of ourselves. Through what disappoint- 
ments, and agonies, and wounds, some of 
us have come to our first real knowledge, 
that we are ignorant of ourselves, and 
cannot therefore govern ourselves. 

This drives us to one conclusion. Our 
demand for perfection can only be met 
by our living, and moving, and having 
our being wholly within the Will of God. 
Our neighbor's law fails through the 
limitation of his knowledge. Our own 
program collapses because of our ig- 
norance. The Will of God moving 
within the realm of His perfect knowl- 
edge leads us on to perfection, and will 
at last set us in His presence unafraid.

PROCURES PLEASURE 

V 

Man^s nature is such that, in addition 
to perfection^ it demands pleasure. How 
that demand is met in the Will of God 
may thus be declared: â€” 

God's Will is perfect, because He is 
love, and only Love can, and Love 
can only, make laws for man 
which will provide him with per- 
sect pleasure. 
That is a double proposition. Let us 
consider it. 

I. Only love can make laws for man 
zvhich will provide him with perfect 
pleasure. â€” Disinterestedness lies at the 

77 

God's Perfect Will 

heart of all pure love. " Love…seek- 
eth not its own." It is almost impossible 
to discuss the true nature of love from 
the midst of the limitations of human life 
as we know it. It is so easy to judge 
love by the partial realization of it that 
has come within our consciousness. We 
love those that love us, those that please 
us, those that like us; and at the root of 
all this, in the last analysis, there is but 
a refined form of selfishness. 

The Divine fact of love is infinitely 
greater than these human imitations. 
Occasionally it seems to take possession 
of a human heart, and is then the subject 
of wonder to all men. Love, however, 
must ever be judged from its essential 
being and manifestation in the character 
of God. There it is wholly unselfish, 
and consists of perfect aflfection for an 
object, without ulterior motive. There 

78 

Procures Pleasure 

only is Shakespeare's description of it 
fully realized. 

" Love is not love 
Which alters when it alteration finds, 
Or bends with the remover to remove: 
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark, 
That looks on tempests and is never shaken." 

When love becomes the motive of law, 
then law conditions the true happiness 
of the one that is loved. To do this, love 
is never blind, but takes the largest pos- 
sible outlook, and acts in its government 
not only for the present moment, but for 
all the issues of that moment; not only 
for the final issues, but also for all the 
present moments that contribute to its 
making. No other motive for law is 
equal to meeting the demand for pleas- 
ure. Righteousness, apart from its re- 
lation to love, may do many cruel things. 
The doctrine of the survival of the fittest, 
79 

God's Perfect Will 

in its higher aspect, is a protest against 
unrightness; but it has within itself no 
remedy for failure, and ruthlessly sweeps 
away all the weak and fallen. The maj- 
esty and dignity of kingship will not en- 
sure the pleasure of the subject in all 
cases. Law growing from selfishness 
will, in the nature of things, only bring 
happiness to those who minister to the 
self-seeking propensity of the law-giver. 
No law that my fellow-man can make 
for me is perfectly to be trusted to en- 
sure my pleasure, because I am never 
certain of the hidden and yet powerful 
motive that may give birth to that law. 
Love only can condition the life of the 
subject in perfect happiness. 

IL Love can only make lazvs for man 
ivhich zvill provide him zvifh perfect 
pleasure. â€” Its very nature, as we have 
80 

Procures Pleasure 

already seen, makes this a necessity. 
Herein lies the proof our present prop- 
osition. The Will of God ensures the 
pleasure of man, because God is love. 
This is, perhaps, at once the simplest and 
sublimest statement that revelation has 
made concerning the nature of God. 
Theologians have spoken of love as an 
attribute of Deity. Should it not rather 
be spoken of as the essence of the Divine, 
of which the attributes are the com- 
ponent parts? As a man's character is 
the sum and substance of his character- 
istics, so is the essence of the Divine the 
sum and substance of Divine attributes. 
Holiness, justice, beneficence â€” all these 
and others lie within the compass of love. 
To deny either is to deny love. To deny 
love is to contradict all. If, then, God 
is love, His Will is the Will of love; and 
the common mistake that law and love 
8i 

God's Perfect Will 

are in any sense antagonistic must be 
once and for ever abandoned. There is 
no divergence between the two. Brown- 
ing sang truly â€” 

" I report, as a man may, of God's work: 
All's love, but all's law." 

In the economy of God, love is law, and 
law is love. 

The twofold denomination of John is 
not without significance. We speak of 
him as the Apostle of Love. Jesus called 
him a Son of Thunder. There is no con- 
tradiction in the thoughts. There was 
never yet an apostle of love who was not 
also a son of thunder. In the writings 
of John, the two words most often oc- 
curring are the words " commandment " 
and " love," and there is no contradic- 
tion, but rather unity of thought in the 
fact. 

82 

Procures Pleasure 

The law of God being then the expres- 
sion of His love, seeks the perfect hap- 
piness of all those who obey it. When 
Jesus upon the Mount enunciated the 
ethics of His kingdom, the first word that 
fell from His lips indicated the purpose 
of His heart. It was the word " Happy." 
To make man happy is the purpose of 
God, and for the realization of that pur- 
pose Jesus came to live, to teach, to die. 
The law He enunciated was the most 
stringent and exacting that humanity 
had ever heard, and it was so because 
love makes no peace with aught that 
harms, and is the most relentless foe of 
every foe of the loved one. 

Every prohibition of God, and every 
command He lays upon men, have their 
reason in His good-will toward men. 
Nothing is denied to the subjects of His 
kingdom capriciously, or merely for the 
83 

God's Perfect Will 

satisfaction of some motive outside these 
subjects. Love prohibits that which, if 
permitted, would blight the life and mar 
the pleasure. It is also true that every 
commandment calling to paths of duty 
is the outbreathing of love. There are 
moments when such pathways are rough 
and thorny and tortuous; but love never 
sends men along them save when, in the 
way, something is to be gained w^hich 
will more than compensate for the suffer- 
ing, and which can only be gained 
through the suffering. 

" Every joy or trial 
Falleth from above, 
Traced upon our dial 
By the Sun of love." 

Man's capacity for pleasure finds its 
full satisfaction when his Hfe is surren- 
dered to the Will of God. There is first 
the immediate delight of obedience. The 
84 

Procures Pleasure 

response to love is in itself the essence of 
delight. This is illustrated from all that 
we know of love in the human relation, 
but its highest realization is to be found 
in this realm of submission to the govern- 
ment of God. Infinite meaning lies 
within the words of Christ, " I delight to 
do Thy will, O my God." 

Not only is there this joy of love's re- 
sponse to love, there is also the hope of 
consummation: for if the present will of 
love be delightful, the perfect issue of 
love will be the perfection of delight. 
Consequently, through all the mystery 
that often surrounds the obedience of 
today, there shines the glow of the per- 
sect consummation which alone can sat- 
isfy the Eternal Love. 

The heaven towards which we look is, 
as to our own condition, realized capacity 
and realized functions of being. The 

God's Perfect Will 

powers which are today suggestions, 
prophecies, will then be possessions; and 
these all, moving within the realm of the 
Divine intention, will create the highest 
delight of which the spirit of man is 
capable. It is in this sense that the old 
word of the Psalmist is true: " In Thy 
presence is fullness of joy; at Thy right 
hand are pleasures for evermore." 

Not, however, to the future merely do 
we look for this answer to the second de- 
mand of our nature. Here and now, to 
abide in the Will of God is to find the se- 
cret of happiness in all life. Submission 
to the King involves the finding of the 
mystic key that opens every avenue of 
pure delight, for in His Will the powers 
which He in love created are no longer 
prostituted to ignoble purposes, but serve 
the purpose of that love creation.

PROMISES PERPETUITY 

VI 

The third demand of man is for per- 
petuity. That also is secured by those 
who dwell wholly within the Will of 
God. 

The argument may be simply stated 
thus: â€” 

God's Will is perfect, because He is, 
and the Eternal alone can make 
laws which include the past, pres- 
ent, and future, so as to secure 
perpetuity. 
Nothing is more restful to the heart 
of man than the sense of the eternity of 
God. The thought is utterly beyond our 
perfect comprehension, for the mind of 
man cannot grasp the thought of eter- 
89 

God's Perfect Will 

nity. The very fact, however, of our in- 
ability to do so is the reason of the se- 
curity we feel when we remember that 
God is Himself eternal. The secrets of 
the past, all unknown to us, are ever pres- 
ent to His omniscient mind. Upon the 
mystery of the future the light of His 
perfect knowledge rests; and the prob- 
lems of today that fret and trouble us 
are seen by Him in their relation to the 
past and to the future, and for that rea- 
son cease to be to Him perplexing, as 
they are to us. 

In the eternity of God, time has but 
one significance, it is perpetually and 
unceasingly " Now." The name by 
which He revealed Himself to Moses at 
the burning bush is full of significance. 
He is the " I AM." Combining this fact 
with those considered in previous chap- 
ters, of His Creatorship and His love, 
90 

Promises Perpetuity 

we argue at once that the laws He makes 
for the creatures of His hand and the 
children of His love, are laws that will 
take in the sum of things, and so con- 
dition the present, that it shall hold 
within it the power and the promise of 
the future. 

Every present law of God for man is 
based upon the fact of the past, and 
moves towards the purpose of the future. 
What He wills for each person today 
takes into account all the forces and facts 
of the past. Previous failings in the in- 
dividual life; tendencies inherited from 
the generations that have gone; the ac- 
cumulated forces that propel men from 
the dead centuries â€” are all present to the 
mind of God, when He arranges the 
program of individual lives. 

So also the future is known to Him. 
The true line of life's development, with 
91 

God's Perfect Will 

all the lines that cross and thwart it. 
Words that we often have to make use of 
are never required in the vocabulary of 
God. We speak of contingency, exi- 
gency, accident. He cannot be surprised. 
Nothing happens, in the sense in which 
we use that word. He marks the ap- 
proach of every foe, knows whence it 
comes, sets the limit of its opposition; 
saying ever to Satan, as He said in the 
case of Job, " So far mayest thou go; 
only here and there thou shalt stay thy 
hand." 

It follows, necessarily, that where life 
is governed only within the Will of God, 
every date and every event become links 
in the chain of a perfect whole. All con- 
tribute to a finality. It is impossible 
here and now for us to discover the re- 
lation of the present moment either to 
past or to future. But that relation is 
92 

Promises Perpetuity 

always present to the mind of God. We 
are permitted occasional gleams of light 
upon this truth as the years of our life 
pass on. The light falls in the act of retro- 
spection. Looking back today to the 
events of years that have passed, we be- 
gin to discover their meaning. They are 
seen to be part of the Divine mosaic. The 
keen disappointment, the whelming sor- 
row, came after all as a necessity out of 
the past, and hold within themselves the 
elements that make the present, and 
color all the future. The present place 
of service and of blessing could not have 
been but for the events that seemed to 
create confusion. 

From this distance we see how God 
was moving in the infinite order of His 
ceaseless love, and what we thought con- 
fusion was but the sign of His progress. 
What light is flung upon the pathway of 
93 

God's Perfect Will 

each day if once diis fact is understood. 
The day is not done with when its sun 
sets. The deeds of any given hour are 
not fully comprehended in the passing 
of its sixty minutes. If the deeds of the 
days have been those planned by God, 
then they are days, the full blossoming 
of which will be found in the perfect 
light of the everlasting day. It has been 
said that every flower that decks the sod 
has its root far back in eternity. So also 
every human life, in the Will and pur- 
pose of God, is linked to the past and to 
the future, and His laws for it forget no 
fact of all the ages. 

Need anything further be written to 
prove the wisdom of abandoning life to 
His Will? See how all other laws fail 
when placed in comparison with this. 
The best-loved friend I have cannot com- 
pass within the facts of certain knowl-

edge the events of the next hour. They 
may advise, but their advice is neces- 
sarily tentative. They would go this way 
if â€” and how much depends upon the if. 
A thousand chances may prove the folly 
of their wisdom, the shortsightedness of 
their policy. 

This is never so with the soul that has 
no law save that of the Divine Will. 

" He always wins who sides with God, 
To him no chance is lost." 

The same criticism will apply to self- 
made programs. One might, per- 
chance, make a program for one's own 
life for a week if one knew all that could 
possibly happen within that week. See- 
ing, however, that that knowledge does 
not extend to the next minute, the folly 
of a self-governed Hfe becomes apparent. 
Of course it is necessary that we should 
95 

God's Perfect Will 

have our program and our plan and 
our arrangement, but the more necessary 
thing is that all such should be prefaced 
by the old-fashioned and almost obsolete 
letters D.V. " If the Lord will, we shall 
both live, and do this or that.…To 
him therefore that knoweth to do good, 
and doeth it not, to him it is sin." Thus 
James states the true attitude of man to- 
wards his future and his God. If our 
plans are made with this reservation, how 
often we shall have to thank God for 
their spoiling; how perpetually has He 
broken up our programm.e in order that 
His Will should be done, and how true 
we have found it to be that â€” 

" God's Will is sweetest to us when 
It triumphs at our cost." 

The restfulness and peace of this atti- 
tude of surrender to the Divine Will lies 
96 

Promises Perpetuity 

in the fact that the Eternal God, Who in 
infinite love has created us, has done so 
for eternal comradeship with Himself; 
and if He govern the life, He will bring- 
it, notwithstanding all the forces that 
seem to be against it, to the place of full 
and undying existence. There is no 
other law of life that will secure this. 
" The world passeth away, and the lust 
thereof, but he that doeth the Will of God 
abideth for ever." From the center of 
that Will man may look out upon change 
and decay, upon death and destruction, 
and know that he is perfectly safe from 
them all; yea, master of every one. 

" Things that once were wild alarms 
Cannot now disturb my rest; 
Closed in everlasting arms, 

Pillowed on the loving breast. 
Oh to lie for ever here, 

Doubt and care and self resign, 
While He whispers in my ear â€” 
I am His, and He is mine!

" Thus is Christianity concerned, not with 
merely a section of life â€” with the ' affairs of the 
soul ' â€” but with all of it. No life â€” as I think 
Luther has said somewhere â€” is more worldly 
than a Christian's. It embraces everything that 
makes us what we are â€” all that, lived in a cer- 
tain light and treated from a certain point of 
view. One of the great wrongs that ecclesi- 
astical Christianity has done religion is to 
disparage or deny this, to give us the impres- 
sion that a Christian life lived in the cloister 
is higher and holier than one lived in the fam- 
ily, the market, the secular arena of the world, 
and to bid us look to types of the former rather 
than the latter for saintship. I cannot find any 
meaning such as this in the fact of Christ. The 
carpenter of Nazareth, who was among men 
* eating and drinking ' â€” He is ' our only Saint.' 
We must secularize saintship by sanctifying the 
secular life." â€” P. Carnegie Simpson (" The 
Fact of Christ"). 

PRACTICABLE BECAUSE OF ITS 

NATURE 

VII 

For the reasons as stated, we grant 
that the Will of God should be the best 
law of life for man. Having granted so 
much, a new question immediately arises: 
Is the doing of the Will possible to man? 
An ideal that cannot be realized may be a 
vision of beauty, but it lacks the essen- 
tial element that creates the true ideal â€” 
that, namely, of practicability. Men do 
not climb after the inaccessible. Men 
make no effort to mount to the moon. 
Grant the accessibility, and distance be- 
comes an incentive to climbing. The 
Will of God is practicable for three rea- 
sons: â€” 

lOI 

God's Perfect Will 

1. Because of its nature. 

2. Because it is revealed. 

3. Because of supernatural power, 

communicated to those who will 
to do it. 
We proceed to deal with these three 
statements in these three chapters. 

The Will of God includes and condi- 
tions all that God has created. Doing the 
Will of God does not consist in the de- 
velopment of the spiritual side of man's 
nature, at the expense of the other sides. 
The apostle prayed for the Thessalonian 
Christians, that their '' spirit and soul 
and body " might " be preserved entire, 
without blame, at the coming of our 
Lord Jesus Christ." 

We are suffering from the art of the 
Old Masters. They gave men a wrong 
conception of God and of sainthood. 
102 

/ 

Practicable Because of Its Nature 

Take, for instance, what Ruskin speaks 
of as " that infinite monstrosity and hy- 
pocrisy, Raphael's cartoon of the charge 
to Peter." Let me give you an analysis 
of his criticism on the picture: â€” 

(i) Twelve apostles, when only seven 
were present. 

(2) Curled hair and sandals, after a 

night in sea mists. 

(3) Dresses with trains â€” an apostolic 

fishing costume. 

(4) No fire of coals, but an Italian 

landscape with villas and 
churches. 
(5) The apostles not round Christ, but 
in a line to be shown. 

That is a fair sample of the conception 

of sainthood which the Old Masters gave 

the world. They lifted men and women 

out of the ordinary experiences of human 

103 

God's Perfect Will 

life, and put them upon impossible planes. 
This was due to a misconception of the 
Will of God. These Old Masters did 
not understand that God does not call 
men away from the commonplaces of the 
busy days, but conditions their life within 
them, until the meanest thing flashes and 
gleams with the glory of the heavens. 

Another illustration is that offered by 
Monasticism. The monastic system was 
the outcome of a pure and holy desire, 
but it was based upon a misconception of 
God. Men desired to serve their age by 
prayer; and to do so, retired from the 
Hurry and rush of life, turning their back 
upon marriage, parenthood, home, and 
friendship. It was a fatal mistake. 
When men retire from the conflict to 
pray, they cut the nerves of prayer. Men 
only pray with prevailing power, who do 
so amid the sobs and sighing of the race. 
104 

( 

Practicable Because of Its Nature 

If the genesis of monasticism was a pure 
desire, its history proves that it ended in 
lewd and awful corruption. 

These illustrations are given to show 
that any conception of God that makes it 
necessary for man to depart from the 
commonplaces of Hfe to find Him, are 
wrong. The Old Masters saw no pos- 
sibility of the identity of an actual fisher- 
man and an apostle. The monks went 
alone to pray, because they thought that 
God was out of the midst of the strife. 

The parish priest, of austerity, 

Climbed up in the high church-steeple, 
To be nearer God, so that he might 

Hand His word down to the people. 

And in sermon script he daily wrote 
What he thought was sent from heaven; 

And he dropped it down on the people's 
heads 
Two times one day in seven. 

105 

God's Perfect Will 

In his age God said, ' Come down and die '; 

And he cried out from the steeple, 
* Where art Thou, Lord? ' and the Lord re- 
plied, 

' Down here among My people.' " 

The Will of God touches us at every 
point in our life, because He is interested 
in all its details. This is illustrated by 
some of the most simple and exquisite 
statements of Scripture. 

*' Put Thou my tears into Thy bot- 
tle." 

** The steps of a good man are ordered 
by the Lord." 

" Thou knowest my going out and my 
coming in." 

" Thou knowest my down-sitting and 
mine uprising." 

God among His people gathering up 
their tears, ordering their steps, know- 
ing their going out. their coming in, their 
io6

down-sitting, their uprising. Then hear 
the words of Jesus. 

" The very hairs of your head are 
numbered." 

" Not a sparrow faUeth to the ground 
without your Father." 

" Take no anxious thought;…your 
Father knoweth that you have need." 

â– If these sentences teach anything, they 
teach the intense interest of God in the 
smallest detail of the life of His children, 
in what we eat, in what wx wear, in our 
recreation, in our homes, in the hidden 
facts of character. He is so interested, 
that He takes us one by one, and thinks 
of, and arranges for, every detail of our 
life. To Him there are no little things. 
What we call great things are but the 
perfect union of the small ones, and every 
small one has the element which makes 
the greatness of the great ones.

"... Nothing's small: 
No lily-muffled hum of a summer-bee, 
But finds some coupling with the spinning stars; 
No pebble at your foot, but proves a sphere; 
No chaffinch, but implies the cherubim." 

By this interest in, and arrangement 
for, all the details of every individual life, 
God makes His Will the simplest, the 
easiest, the most practical law of life. It 
is within that Will that man, in the best 
sense of the word, may be natural, true 
to the possibilities of his own being, un- 
afraid. 

One other word as to the nature of the 
Will of God. Not only does it include 
and condition all that He has created in 
infinite wisdom, it also manipulates all 
circumstances. The proof of this is to be 
found, in the majority of cases, by ret- 
rospection. Looking back, how mar- 
vellous is the mosaic of the Divine ar-

ness yonder we thought the Hght had for 
ever failed, and yet we were but in the 
ante-chamber of clearer vision. Another 
day we counted ourselves defeated, but 
today we see that the defeat was in 
itself the greatest victory. God's trans- 
mutations run through the years. He is 
ever bringing gold for brass, silver for 
iron, brass for wood, iron for stones. All 
contradictory circumstances He presses 
into the service of progression. It 
was not idly written in the Song of Solo- 
mon, " As the lily among the thorns, so 
is my love among the daughters." The 
thorn and the lily both live in the same 
soil, in the same atmosphere. Both re- 
ceive the same ministry from without, 
and yet how different the result. To 
those outside the Will of God, sorrow, 
trouble, disappointment, come; and the 
tendency is to harden and embitter. To 
109 

God's Perfect Will 

those living in the Will of God, the same 
sorrow, the same trouble, the same dis- 
appointment, come; and the effect is that 
of transformation into new grace, and 
tenderness, and beauty. Sorrow is a 
minister, creating character for those 
who dwell in the Will of God; for such, 
sorrow is turned into joy. The Will of 
God, including and conditioning all God 
has created, and manipulating all circum- 
stances, is a possible and practicable law 
of life for man.

affirms it to be supreme. There is no debate as 
to whether the sun or the moon is the light of 
the world. Imagine a dark night, and an ob- 
server who has never seen the sun: a star sud-

with delight; presently the moon shines with 
all her gentle strength, and the observer says: 
* This is the fulfillment of the promise; can

every cloud is filled with light; every mountain 
is crowned with a strange glory; every leaf in 
the forest is silvered; the sea becomes as bur-

face of the earth: under such a vision, the ob- 
server knows that this is the true light â€” the 
sovereign, all-dominating flame. It is so in 
the revelation of Jesus Christ. When the eyes 
of men are opened to see Him in all His grace 
and wisdom i.nd sympathy â€” in all the suffi-

Spirit â€” the heart is satisfied, and every rival

While the fact that the Will of God 
includes and conditions all His creation 
is a most blessed one, yet it is not suffi- 
cient to prove its practicability. One per- 
son may be deeply interested in the his- 
tory of another, but this fact is of little 
practical use to the one in whom this in- 
terest is taken, unless it is made known. 
I may have plans which are the very best 
possible for my children, but the first 
conditions of their being carried into ef- 
sect by these children is that I should 
make them known to them. In the very 
nature of the case, the Will of God for 
every human life must be the best; and 
113 

God's Perfect Will 

because of His intimate acquaintance 
with, and interest in, every part of the 
being He has created, it must be possible 
to do that Will if it can be known. 

That this Will may be discovered by 
every human being is the distinct claim 
of Christianity. The central verity of 
Christianity is Christ, and He is the rev- 
elation in a Person of God's Will for 
man. Moreover, the perpetual method 
of God with man is that of revealing to 
him immediately the Divine intention and 
purpose concerning him. We say, there- 
fore, that the Will of God is practicable 
because it is revealed. 

In the life of Jesus there was a perfect 
unfolding of the thought that was in 
the heart of God when He said " Let Us 
make man in Our image" (Genesis 1:26). 
He was indeed the " image of the invis- 
ible God " (Colossians 1:15); " the very image 
114 

Practicable Because Revealed 

of His substance" (Hebrews 1:3). ''The 
Word became flesh, and dwelt among us 
(and we beheld His glory, the glory as 
of the only begotten from the Father), 
full of grace and truth" (John 1:14). 
This is John's testimony concerning Him. 
It is a sad commentary upon the blind- 
ness of the human heart through sin, that 
the vast mass of the people who came 
into contact with Him during the years 
of His sojourn upon the earth, saw no 
beauty in Him that they should desire 
Him. Through the process of the cen- 
turies, and by the teaching of the Spirit, 
men are coming to understand the won- 
derful glory and beauty of His Person 
and character, and are now recognizing 
that all perfection of life, individually, 
socially, religiously, finds in Him its first 
and chief expression. 

Individually, He yielded Himself 
115 

God's Perfect Will 

wholly to the claim of God, and then 
faced Hfe's duties and responsibilities 
with a courage and devotion that trans- 
muted the common things of the passing 
days into service so sacred, that it con- 
tributed to the final glories of the ages to 
come. He toiled upon the earth as a 
man, interested in the flowers of the field, 
and the birds of the air, and the children 
of the street. Gentle and strong, trusted 
of the weakest, feared of all tyrants. He 
moved without strife of words, or lifting 
up the voice in self-advertisement, 
through the Divinely marked program 
of the waiting years, to the cross of ulti- 
mate pain, which He made the center and 
source of all healing for wounded and 
broken humanity. He was the supreme 
illustration of the possibilities of indi- 
vidual life conditioned ever and only in 
the Will of God.

â€¢In all social relationships His action 
was such as to reveal God's Will in an 
entirely new light to men, thus revolu- 
tionizing human thought and human 
society. Without staying for a single il- 
lustration, let the mind dwell for one mo- 
ment on His unvarying attitude towards 
women; and then remember how, since 
the years of His human life, woman the 
world over has lived in a new realm, for 
the day of her final emancipation dawned 
with His appearing. His obedience to 
government was exhibited in the paying 
of taxes, and was startlingly proved by 
the fact that when they would encompass 
His Death, His enemies had to fall back 
upon a religious charge, having no civil 
one to prefer against Him. His attitude 
of tenderness towards all sinners incur- 
red the condemnation of the religious 
enthusiasts of His day, who had so mis- 
117

read the heart of God as to imagine that 
love was for the good, and nothing but 
stern anger and vindictiveness for the 
fallen. 

Religiously He gave us a radiant rev- 
elation of the truth so hard for men to 
learn, that religion is not an addendum 
to life, but is life itself. With Him God 
was first; and there was no second. The 
critics of the ages may be challenged to 
discover a single action of His life as 
chronicled that was not true to the key- 
word of that life, " I must be about My 
Father's business." 

In that perfect life God revealed His 
Will for every human being. It was 
not the life of an angel visitor. Its glory 
lay in the fact of its humanness, and that 
fact brings it within the realm of the pos- 
sible to every son and daughter of the 
human race.

Not only once in a person has the Will 
been revealed; it is perpetually and im- 
mediately revealed to all such as desire 
to know it. The work of the Holy Spirit 
is ever that of indicating to man the in- 
tention and purpose of God for him. 

This may be stated in another way. 
The Holy Spirit is to " take of the things 
of Christ and reveal them to men; " and 
this is infinitely more than explaining the 
doctrines concerning Him. It is the 
showing to individual souls of the way 
in which, under all the circumstance of 
life, Christ would think, or act, or speak. 
Jesus was, and is, the " Light that 
lighteth every man that cometh into the 
world," and thus He is perpetually the 
revelation of the Divine Will to men. 

It does not necessarily follow that 
when the light falls upon the spirit of 
man, he understands the source of the 
119 

God's Perfect Will 

light. The light is the first fact; the 
understanding of the source follows. 
The little child may play with the golden 
sunshine, and yet have no knowledge of 
the sun. That will come in the process of 
the years. Let any person, if it be pos- 
sible, go back in life to that moment when 
the conscience first detected the differ- 
ence between right and wrong. That 
shining of the light of right was the out- 
shining of the glory of Christ's perfec- 
tion upon the spirit, and the consequent 
revelation of the Will of God. 

All this was not then understood, but 
enough was understood to make man re- 
sponsible. If in that moment the right 
was chosen, Christ was obeyed, and the 
Will of God was done. If the wrong 
was chosen, the light was insulted, and 
the government of God rebelled against. 

120 

Practicable Because Revealed 

Thus God does reveal His Will to man, 
and man chooses between obedience and 
disobedience. The measure and clear- 
ness of personal revelation depends upon 
this act of man. To obedient souls the 
light becomes perpetually brighter, for he 
" that doeth the Will shall know of the 
teaching." To those who disobey, the 
light dies away, until they stumble in 
darkness upon the mountains, and im- 
agine God does not reveal His Will to 
man; whereas the truth is, that having 
" loved the darkness rather than the 
light," they have become blind. 

To the soul new-born the will of God 
is revealed again, not as a perfect and 
final program of life, but in a claim 
demanding immediate obedience, and 
then by successive revelations concerning 
the pathway of life. So that a man 

121 

God's Perfect Will 

may say, as he steps out upon his new 
life, 

" One step I see before me, 
'Tis all I need to see." 

When Saul of Tarsus was appre- 
hended of Jesus Christ, he was not told 
that he was to become the apostle to the 
Gentiles, the mightiest missionary of the 
Cross, the greatest theologian of the 
Church. Jesus said to him, " Rise, enter 
into the city, and it shall be told thee 
what thou must do." The next step was 
marked. Taking this, another was re- 
vealed; and so ever on, until at last, 
saying, " I have fought a good fight; 
I have finished my course; I have kept 
the faith " â€” he passed to the place of per- 
sect light and perfect life.

PRACTICABLE BY NEW LIFE 

IX 

In writing to the Philippians, Paul 
says, " For it is God which worketh 
in you both to will and to work, for 
His good pleasure " (2:13). This state- 
ment occurs between two injunctions. 
The first has reference to personal salva- 
tion, and the second declares the duty of 
man in relation to the world. The first 
reads, " Work out your own salvation 
with fear and trembling "; and the sec- 
ond, " Do all things without murmurings 
and disputings; that ye may be blame- 
less and harmless, children of God with- 
out blemish, in the midst of a crooked 
and perverse generation, among whom 
125 

God's Perfect Will 

ye are seen as lights in the world." The 
declaration referred to brings both the 
positive and relative statements within 
the realm of practical possibility, " For 
it is God which worketh in you." This 
Divine inworking makes the human out- 
working easy, and simple, and delight- 
ful. For every demand made upon us 
as Christian men and women, there is 
sufficient, overwhelming supply in the 
communication of Divine energy. 

" God worketh in you." This implies 
the actual presence of God at the center 
of our being. The very simplicity of 
these words renders them difficult of 
understanding; for no man understands 
the complex and marvelous mechanism 
of his own personality. God worketh in 
you â€” not outside, but in â€” in the place 
where thought is born, and the throne of 
the will is set up, and the affections have 
126 

Practicable by New Life 

their seat; in the inward shrine of the 
being God worketh. 

Put emphasis now on another word. 
" God zvorketh in you." He is there, not 
merely holding possession while we 
work, but also to 

" Direct, control, suggest each day, 
All we design, or do, or say; 
That all our powers, with all their might, 
In His sole glory may unite." 

** God worketh in you." The value of 
this statement may be learned by insert- 
ing another word in place of " in." " For 
it is God which worketh for you." By 
this alteration the message is robbed of 
its power in a moment. To work for 
us, may be to work apart from us, with- 
out consultation with us. This is sug- 
gestive of duality, which is not always 
necessarily a harmony. 

Try another preposition. "It is God 
127 

God's Perfect Will 

which worketh with you." That would 
indicate some one by the side of us, will- 
ing, when the burden becomes too heavy, 
to help to bear it; willing when the path- 
way becomes difficult, to come into con- 
sultation. This also is suggestive of dual 
personality, and perchance conflict. 

" God which worketh in you " implies 
perfect union. God in you, creating de- 
sire, energizing the will, so that the will 
becomes, not merely as a poetical senti- 
ment, but as a glorious fact, the Will 
of God. That is, indeed, the supreme 
glory of the Christian position â€” " it is 
God which worketh," not " for " merely; 
not " with " only; but " it is God which 
worketh in you." 

" It is God which worketh in you both 

to will and to do." Two facts are here 

stated which are yet one, for willing and 

doing are always united. " To will " â€” 

128 

Practicable by New Life 

that touches the inner Hfe, the springs of 
action; " to do " â€” that touches the outer 
life, the streams of action. 

Think first of the inner, " to will." 
This word has within it the thought of 
active determination of what is to be 
done. Not determination apart from 
ourselves, but God in us, taking hold of 
our wills, creating our desires â€” some- 
times through indirect agencies â€” giving 
us desire in a certain direction, affecting 
and molding our wills, drawing them 
into the avenues of true action, by His 
own indwelling. " It is God which 
worketh in you to will." If this be true, 
then the will, so created, must necessarily 
result in the harmony of our wills with 
His own. 

The work of God does not end here. 
" It is God which worketh in you to will 
and to do." As the thought of the in- 
129 

God's Perfect Will 

working God, wz7//n^, touches the springs 
of action, so necessarily the thought of 
God doing touches the streams of action. 
" It is God which worketh in you to will 
and to work." It might truthfully be 
translated " to effectually work." The 
suggestion is not of the doing that fails, 
but of the doing that succeeds: not of 
the effort that tries, but of the effort 
which triumphs. 

This union of the purified will, and the 
energized life, is equal to the accom- 
plishment of the double purpose: " Work 
out your own salvation," and " be blame- 
less and harmless…in the midst of a 
crooked and perverse generation, among 
whom ye shine as lights in the world." 
The poor, weak, paralyzed, sin-smitten 
soul rises into the dignity of a new life, 
confronts the future with hope, faces his 
enemies with defiance, and says: " I can 
130 

Practicable by New Life 

do all things in Him that strengtheneth 
me. I will work out my own salvation: 
I will live the life which is blameless, 
harmless, without rebuke, because it is 
God which worketh in me to will and to 
do." 

What will be the result? " His good 
pleasure; " that which gives His heart 
satisfaction. If we shrink from that, we 
shrink from all the blessedness within 
the thought. " His good pleasure," the 
thing that pleases Him. Go back to the 
story of creation. When God had made 
the earth, and put man upon it, " God 
saw everything that He had made, and, 
behold, it was very good " â€” God's good 
pleasure. God was pleased with His 
own work; found delight in its perfec- 
tion. 

There came a day when God could say 
this no more â€” a day when sin had en- 
131 

God's Perfect Will 

tered. The sigh and sob of humanity be- 
gan amid the trees of the garden of God, 
and the great surging sorrow of the race 
was born amid the hills of perfection. 
From then onward the heart of God was 
not at rest until, long, weary, and yet 
necessary centuries having passed, there 
came " the second Adam, the Lord from 
heaven, the quickening Spirit." 

If we would know the good pleasure 
of God, man must be seen in all his per- 
section. In Christ we have the revela- 
tion of perfect manhood. Think of His 
perfection of tenderness. His beauty of 
character, of all the great overwhelming 
strength which centered in His sacred 
Person. In beholding Him, behold the 
" good pleasure of God." " It is God 
which worketh in you both to will and to 
do of His good pleasure." 

To make us what Jesus was, God 
132 

Practicable by New Life 

works within us; and until that is finally 
accomplished, the heart of God will never 
be at rest concerning- us: not until that 
moment dawns, which must come for all 
who put their trust in Him, when the 
perfect Son of the living God shall pre- 
sent the many sons whom He brings to 
glory, in the presence of His glory, with- 
out blemish in exceeding joy. That is 
the intended issue; that is the consum- 
mation; that is the crowning and the joy. 
This view of life contained within vital 
Christianity is a declaration of our pos- 
sibilities. We are equal to this, because 
God is equal to it. We have nothing 
which we have not received; but we have 
received something in our creation which 
makes us equal to that. Before any be- 
ing can reach the altitude of true suc- 
cess, there must be within that being the 
possibility of reaching the altitude. We 
133 

God's Perfect Will 

are made in the image of the invisible 
God, with the stamp of Divine possession 
upon us. Shall we not swing the heart's 
door widely open that He may come in, 
to work in us '' both to will and to work, 
for His good pleasure "?

THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION 

X 

So far we have considered the subject 
of the Word of God within the compass 
of probationary life. The perfection possi- 
ble today is that of condition which en- 
sures progress; and the possibility of 
progress ever speaks of something not 
yet attained. The supreme consciousness 
of those who today are most certainly 
living within the Will of God is that of 
incompleteness. All is partial, limited. 
By comparison with the exceeding worth 
and beauty of our Lord, we feel that our 
worship is almost worthless, and we are 
constantly constrained to say that, 

" Hosannas languish on our tongues. 
And our devotion dies." 

137 

God's Perfect Will 

And when we have done the fullest day's 
work possible to us, having, so far as 
we know, filled the hours with sacrificial 
service, we yet have to say, " At best we 
are unprofitable servants." When we 
have walked in the Will as revealed to 
us for the present moment, we are always 
conscious that His ultimate Will is so 
much better than any present realiza- 
tion. This sense of shortcoming is in 
itself an incentive to diligence. It is be- 
cause we have '* not yet apprehended " 
. .. that *' forgetting the things which 
are behind," we " press on toward the 
goal." This pushing towards the goal, 
however, does not mark dissatisfaction 
with the discipline of the pathway. Abid- 
ing in the Will of God, we recognize that 
all the circumstances of life are necessary 
for our perfecting, and are overruled by 
Infinite Love. 

138 

The Ultimate Realization 

" Stayed upon Jehovah, 
Hearts are fully blessed, 
Finding as He promised, 
Perfect peace and rest." 

The questions yet will arise, What is to 
be the issue? whither does the pathway 
tend? It is with this subject that the 
present chapter deals, not exhaustively, 
but by suggestion. 

Much has been written on the future 
condition of the saints. Richard Baxter 
wrote a treatise, in four parts and forty- 
six chapters, full of thought and beauty; 
and many others have contributed to the 
valuable literature. Our thought in this 
chapter is to be confined to the subject 
of the doing of the Will of God; and 
there are four facts recorded in the New 
Testament which are illuminative of the 
subject. 

139 

God's Perfect Will 

â€¢I. Unclouded Vision. 
Paul says, *' Fcr now we see in a mir- 
ror darkly; but then face to face" (i 
Cor. 13:12); and John declares, " We 
shall see Him even as He is " ( i John 
3:2). After faith has had its perfect 
work, it will be swallowed up in sight. 
Today we love, not having seen. Con- 
scious of His presence, apprehending in 
some measure His love and beauty, we 
walk by faith amid the mists and mys- 
teries, or underneath the blue, which is 
also the limitation of vision. 

" Soon the whole, 
Like a parched scroll, 
Shall before my amazed sight uproll; 
And, without a screen, 
At one burst be seen 
The Presence wherein I have ever been." 

H. Perfect Correspondence. 
The first result of this, according to 
John, will be that of perfect corre- 
140 

The Ultimate Realization 

spondence with our Master. " We shall 
be like Him" (1 John 3:2). In the 
moment of vision^ the word of the Mas- 
ter on the Mount of Beatitudes â€” whether 
that word was promise or command, or 
both â€” will be fulfilled in our experience; 
*â– ' ye shall be perfect, even as your heav- 
enly Father is perfect." All the possi- 
bilities of our being will be fulfilled. 
Everything that was in the thought of 
God for us, as to capacity, will be .al- 
ized, and we shall thus be prepared to 
fulfill the highest functions of our life. 

As today it is true that where there 
is no vision, the people perish; and the 
constant cry of the human heart is that 
of Philip, " Show us the Father, and it 
sufficeth us "; and the immediate con- 
sciousness of the soul that has even the 
partial vision of God, seeing through a 
glass darkly, is that of healing; so at 
141 

God's Perfect Will 

last the full and unclouded vision will be 
final salvation, perfect healing, and ab- 
solute satisfaction. Nay, does not the 
thought of the apostle overtake and run 
ahead of all these thoughts, glorious as 
they are. " We shall be like Him.'* 
Nothing can be added to this. It defies 
analysis. If an uninspired statement, 
it is the most daring blasphemy of the 
mind of man. If the word is Spirit- 
taught, it is the most gracious unveiling 
of the infinite love of God. Like Him, 
and therefore fitted for fellowship of 
thought and action; Hke Him, and so 
falling into line with all His mighty 
movements through the unexplored 
spaces and the unborn ages. 

HI. Full Knowledge. 

Paul speaks of another result accruing 
from unclouded vision. " Now I know 
142 

The Ultimate Realization 

in part; but then shall I know even as 
also I have been known " ( 1 Corinthians 13:
12). The messages of the Spirit to the 
Church, delivered through human agents, 
are all messages which met the need of 
the writer, and so appeal to thousands of 
similar temperaments. The Spirit's dec- 
laration of correspondence through John 
answers the question of spiritual devo- 
tion. The Spirit's message of full 
knowledge through Paul answers the 
problem of mental activity. Through all 
the system of Paul's writing his mind is 
discovered active, alert, mighty, pressing 
on, desiring to know. He thinks of the 
Spirit as " knowing the deep things of 
God." His perpetual prayer for his chil- 
dren in the faith is that they may have 
full knowledge of God; and here, after 
describing in language that seems as 
though it might be a part of the poetry 
143 

God's Perfect Will 

of heaven, the nature and the activity of 
love, his active mind reasserts itself, and 
he seems to lift his eyes and gaze away 
to the land of light, and exult in the con- 
sciousness that " Then I shall know even 
as also I have been known." Thus we 
learn that the condition of heaven will be 
that of perfect light. The problems that 
vex us today; the perpetually recurring 
mysteries that demand repeated acts of 
faith â€” these w411 all find their answer, 
not so much in the process of teaching 
or revealing, but in the vision of the 
Master Himself. Seeing, we shall know. 
Seeing face to face, we shall know even 
as we are known. 

IV. Unceasing Service. 

Out of these grows the fourth glorious 
fact, that of unceasing service. " They 
serve Him day and night in His temple " 
144 

The Ultimate Realization 

(Revelation 7:15). "His servants shall do 
Him service; and they shall see His 
face " (Revelation 22:3, 4). It is not within 
the purpose of this volume to discuss 
the nature of the service. The fact is 
enough. We shall see Him, and want 
to serve. We shall be like Him, and be 
able to serve. We shall know, and be 
prepared to serve. Inspiration for serv- 
ice in vision; equipment for service in 
correspondence; preparation for service 
in knowledge! Thus Himself will be 
the reason of all the service of the new 
life, and therefore His Will will be the 
plane of heaven's activity. 

" Then we shall be where we would be; 
Then we shall be what we should be; 
Things which are not now, nor could be, 
Then shall be our own." 

The last words of the fourth book of 
the Psalms declare the call of God to 
145 

God's Perfect Will 

men, " Let all the people say, Amen; 
Hallelujah" (Psalm 106:48, R. v., viarg.). 
Let there be acquiescence in the Divine 
Will, followed by a note of praise. This 
is the order of faith's activity â€” first, 
Amen; and then in faith, Hallelujah. 
Praise grows out of obedience and sub- 
mission; resolute obedience in the power 
of faith is ever preparing for the song. 
There is nothing better in this world, no 
higher experience, than that we should, 
to every revelation of the Will of God, 
utter our whole-hearted Amen, and 
crown it with our joyous Hallelujah. 

But presently, in the light of the un- 
clouded vision; in the power of a perfect 
correspondence to the likeness of our 
Lord; in the light of full knowledge, and 
in the gladness of unceasing service â€” we 
shall reverse the order of these great 
words. " After these things I heard as it 
146 

The Ultimate Realization 

were a great voiee of a great multitude 
in heaven, saying, Hallelujah. And a 
second time they say. Hallelujah.…
And the four and twenty elders and the 
four living creatures fell down and wor- 
shipped God that sitteth on the throne, 
saying. Amen; Hallelujah…And I 
heard as it were the voice of a great 
multitude, and as the voice of many wa- 
ters, and as the voice of mighty thun- 
ders, saying. Hallelujah " (Rev. xix. i- 
6). Here first the song, and then the 
submission, and yet again the song. It 
is that vision of the perfect consumma- 
tion that inspires the song. 

At last all opposing forces are over- 
come, and the kingdom of the heavens 
is realized through all the vast realms 
over which it is God's right to reign. 

At last the prayer taught by Christ is 
answered, the Name is hallowed, the 
147 

God's Perfect Will 

kingdom come^ the Will is done, and the 
unending Hallelujah follows the unHm- 
ited Amen. 

Then begins the absolutely perfect 
service of which all the imperfect service 
of these probationary days is the hardly 
articulate prophecy. Then life moves 
unchecked, unhindered, toward highest 
fornis of expression and most glorious 
inter-relation, because it is absolutely 
homed in the Will of God. 

Bear me on Thy rapid wing, 

Everlasting Spirit! 
Where bright choirs of angels sing, 

And Thy saints inherit; 
Waiting round the Eternal throne, 
Joys immortal are their own: 
This the cry of every one â€” 
* Glory to the Incarnate Son! ' 

Four and twenty elders rise 
From their princely station, 

Shout His glorious victories â€” 
Sing His great salvation, 
148 

The Ultimate Realization 

Cast their crowns before the throne, 
Cry, in reverential tone, 
'' Holy, Holy, Holy One, 
Glory be to God alone! ' 

Hark! the thrilling symphonies 

Seem within to seize us; 
Add we to their holy lays â€” 

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! 
Sweetest note in angels' song. 
Sweetest sound on mortal tongue, 
Sweetest anthem ever known, 
Jesus, Jesus reigns alone."

Sentest down the Holy Ghost:

EPILOGUE 

All life's urgency is concentrated on 
the present moment. Today is all that 
we possess. Yesterday has passed from 
us. Tomorrow is not ours. God's time 
for His people is indicated by the two 
words " now " and '* today." Our study, 
therefore, of the subject of the Will of 
God is of practical and immediate im- 
portance in its bearing on the interests 
of the present. If we remember *' all the 
way which the Lord our God hath led 
us," it is only in order that, taking warn- 
ing from our failures, and deriving en- 
couragement from the unfailing faith- 
fullness of God, we may " forget the 
things that are behind " in our devotion 
to present duty. If we contemplate the 
153 

God's Perfect Will 

coming glory, it is only that its light may 
be a source of inspiration to us as we 
" run with patience the race that is set 
before us." The Will of God is the su- 
preme subject in every life. The Old 
and New Testaments alike testify to its 
importance. Within that Will man finds 
perfection, pleasure, permanence. It is 
practicable because of its nature, its rev- 
elation, and the fact of its being accom- 
panied with the gift of life, which makes 
it possible to obey. It is glorious, indeed, 
for heaven itself lies within the compass 
of its thought. There remains one sub- 
ject of immediate practical moment. 
How may we know the Will of God for 
today, in all the details of the hours as 
they come and go; and how may we 
discover it in any crises that may arise? 

Two preliminary conditions must be 
fulfilled, those, namely, of desire and de- 
154 

Epilogue 

votion. The desire must amount to 
readiness to obey. The devotion must 
be of that practical nature that seeks to 
know and at all cost follows to do. These 
conditions being fulfilled, light may be 
expected in three ways: 

From the Word of God. 

From the immediate illumination of 

the indwelling Spirit. 
From the combination of circum- 
stances. 
Let us examine these separately, and 
then in their inter-relation. 

I. The Three Indications. 

(i) The Word of God. â€” For the most 
part, the Bible does not lay down rules 
of human conduct; it enunciates princi- 
ples. There are exceptions to be found, 
arising out of some local circumstances 
that demanded clear and explicit state- 
155 

God^s Perfect Will 

ment of duty. But as the Bible is a Book 
for all time and habits and manners 
change, the framing of rules, which 
must necessarily change with change of 
local conditions, would have defeated the 
high end in view. The enunciation of 
principles, on the other hand, which 
never change with changing circum- 
stances, calls forth on the part of man, in 
every successive generation, his reason- 
ing and reflective powers, and answers 
the purpose of righteousness. 

In coming to the Word of God, there- 
fore, for understanding of the Will of 
God, we are not to search for texts to 
defend private judgments. Nor are we, 
on the other hand, to play tricks with the 
Bible, in order to discover accidental 
messages to help us in forming judg- 
ments. We are regularly, and devotion- 
ally, and intelligently, to study, in order 
Isaiah6 

Epilogue 

that we may discover the revelation of 
principles. Where this is done as a habit 
of the life, the mind will act under the 
power of these principles, and the conclu- 
sions arrived at will be in harmony with 
the intention of God. 

(2) The Illumination of the Spirit. â€” 
The doctrine of the inner light is not 
sufficiently taught. To the individual be- 
liever, who is, by the very fact of rela- 
tionship to Christ, indwelt by the Holy 
Spirit of God, there is granted the direct 
impression of the Spirit of God on the 
spirit of man, imparting the knowledge 
of His Will in matters of the smallest 
and greatest importance. This has to be 
sought and waited for. It is at this point 
that it may be well for the seeker to take 
counsel with some Fellow Christian , who 
in prayer and conversation may be en- 
abled to thrown light upon the problem. 
157 

God's Perfect Will 

It should, however, be remembered 
that others can only give testimony as to 
their view of the problem suggested. 
Such testimony is of great value. It can- 
not, however, be final, and should only 
be given as contributing thought, which 
may aid in solution. No Spirit-taught 
man or woman will pretend to be able to 
decide for a second person. Each must 
at last, having received help, it may be, 
from conference with other Christians, 
pass into some place of utter loneliness, 
where only the voice of the Spirit is 
heard. To such waiting, a clear and 
definite answer must come. 

(3) The Combination of Circum- 
stances. â€” ^In the fact of the Divine gov- 
ernment, this may be spoken of as the 
opening and shutting of doors. There is 
no room for doubt that God does, in in- 
finite wisdom and power, manipulate the 
158 

Epilogue 

facts and details of all human lives, in 
such a way as to make " all things work 
together for good to them that love God/' 
The open door does not necessarily mean 
the easy pathway. This is a common 
mistake. One has often heard persons 
say the way is made plain, and by 
" plain " they mean easy. And yet, those 
who know most of the immediate gov- 
ernment of God, will confess that the 
most plain pathway has often been the 
most difficult. 

The open door is an opportunity 
created, which is in harmony with the 
principles of the Divine government as 
declared in Scripture, and the desire for 
which has been created in that fellow- 
ship with God into which no other inter- 
est has been allowed to enter. This is a 
most solemn consideration, and needs the 
severest caution. There is no realm of 
159 

God's Perfect Will 

human life into which the enemy more 
successfully passes, and in which he 
works more destruction, than that of mo- 
tive. Desires based upon motives other 
than the highest will often discover open 
doors which are quite other than those 
which God would open. 

II. The Threefold Indication. 

The value of the three indications dealt 
with, lies in the fact that not in any one 
of them is to be discovered the warrant 
for action, but in their combination. 

( 1 ) With regard to the Word of God, 
many principles of action therein recog- 
nized are not meant for all men at all 
times. There must also be the inner light 
and the open door. 

(2) With regard to the leading of the 
Spirit, it cannot be too constantly re- 
affirmed that such leading is never con- 

160 

Epilogue 

tradictory to the truth of Scripture. 
There is so much idle talk today about 
the leading of the Lord, that at this point 
one would desire to speak most strongly 
and solemnly. Some awful instances of 
gross immorality have resulted from peo- 
ple following what they imagined to be 
the guidance of the Holy Spirit, even 
though the action was in direct disobedi- 
ence to the most emphatic statements and 
requirements of the law of God. This is 
blasphemy of the worst kind. Whenever, 
therefore, it is supposed that the Spirit is 
leading, it is of the gravest importance 
that such leading should be tested by the 
principles of the Word. 

And again, the Spirit never leads with- 
out opening the doors sooner or later. 
Tlicre may have been the waiting of long 
discipline â€” and abiding in the Will of 
God means rejoicing in all such disci- 
pline â€” and patient waiting for His open- 
1:6i 

God's Perfect Will 

ing of the door, even when the light is 
clearly shining as to the Spirit's ultimate 
intention. 

(3) The open door that necessitates 
departure from Scriptural teaching is the 
work of the devil; and no matter how 
remarkable the success that appears to 
follow efforts ostensibly made in the in- 
terests of the kingdom of God, if the 
base of operation is not loyalty to the re- 
vealed Will of God in Holy Scripture, 
the fabric erected is but " hay, wood, 
stubble," to be destroyed in the cleansing 
fire at last. 

And yet again, the open door, in 
harmony with the principles of Scripture, 
is not to be entered, save as a personal 
call is heard, and one is able to say, I do 
this because I have the witness of God's 
Spirit with my spirit that He so wills it. 

Thus to summarize. We have ever the 
162 

Epilogue 

threefold test, which is invaluable as to 
everyday details, and in the crises of life; 
the truth of God, contained in the Word 
of God; the purpose of God indicated 
by the Spirit of God; the government of 
God exhibited in the opening of doors by 
God. 

One perpetual condition remains, that 
of obedience. This word, it will be seen, 
is not here lightly used. It presupposes 
a desire to know and to do, expressing 
itself in devotion to seek and to obey. 
Such obedience will ever be based on the 
perfect confidence of the spirit of man 
in the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
the love of God, and the communion of 
the Holy Spirit. Where this confidence 
exists, the obedience will be unquestion- 
ing, immediate, complete. 

The tendency of the age is to softness. 
Some may read this final message, and 
turning from it say. This is not easy. 
163 

God's Perfect Will 

Easy! When did Christ suggest ease to 
men in the method of their own making? 
Did He not solemnly warn those who 
would follow Him to count the cost, and 
indicate that the pathway of His foot- 
prints necessitated the denial of self and 
the taking of the Cross? If the perfec- 
tion of character, and pleasure of life, 
and permanence of being for which we 
profess to be desirous, are ever to be real- 
ized, it will be by strenuous action; time, 
thought, energy, are all necessary. 

Let the end be as the beginning. There 
is but one thing that matters. It is that 
God's Will should be done. To that end 
let every one cast sloth away, and, '' gird- 
ing up the loins of the mind, be sober and 
set the hope perfectly on the grace that 
is to be brought unto you at the revela- 
tion of Jesus Christ." The ultimate issue 
will be perfect compensation for all the 
toil of the pathway tliat leads thereto.
