PRELIMINARY 

*^ And it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, that 
when He ceased, one of His disciples said unto Him, Lord, teach us 
to pray, even as John also taught his disciples. And He said unto 
them. When ye pray, say. Father, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy 
kingdom come. Give us day by day our daily bread. And forgive 
us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted 
to us, and bring us not into temptation. 

^^ And He said unto them. Which of you shall have a friend, and 
shall go unto him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me 
three loaves; for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and 
I have nothing to set before him; and he from within shall answer 
and say, Trouble me not; the door is now shut, and my children are 
with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee? I say unto you, 
Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet 
because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as 
he needeth. And I say unto you. Ask, and it shall be given you: 
seek, and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and 
to him that knocketh it shall be opened. And of which of you that 
is a father shall his son ask a loaf, and he give him a stone? or a 
fish, and he for a fish give him a serpent 7 Or if he shall ask an 
egg, will he give him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to 
give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your 
heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him? ^^ â€” 
Luke 11: 1-13.

PRELIMINARY 

ITever did the disciples prefer a more impor- 
tant request than when they said " Lord, teach us 
to pray ": and no petition was more graciously 
answered. The church today needs to bring that 
petition first of all, but she needs to do so remem- 
bering that she already has the answer in all 
spaciousness and clearness. Whatever may have 
been the case with the first disciples it is certainly 
true of us that before we " call " He " answers." 

I have chosen as the general title of this book 
" The Practice of Prayer," because the purpose of 
its publication is preeminently practical. Any 
discussion of the doctrine of prayer which does 
not issue in the practice of prayer is not only not 
helpful, it is dangerous. At the same time that 
practice will be greatly helped by an apprehen- 
sion of the relative Christian doctrine. 

That there is need for its consideration is granted 
on every hand. Side by side with a great enrich- 
ment there is a wide-spread impoverishment in the 
Church of God. The consciousness of wealth 
creates the sense of poverty, and it is because we 
rejoice in our gain that we mourn over our lack. 

As to enrichment, there can be no question that 
the church's appreciation of Jesus Christ is keener 
and more spacious today than it has ever been. 
There is today a wide-spread consciousness of the 

11 

12 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

human Christ and this has brought assurance of 
His interest in all departments of human life. 
Coincidentally with this there has arisen a convic- 
tion of His universality, and while rejoicing as 
never in the warmth and nearness of the Flesh, we 
have come to a larger apprehension of the infini- 
tude of the Word. In practical equipment for 
service too the Church in men, in money, and in 
methods, is far in advance of any preceding age. 

Yet in all these things there is a sense of lack and 
of poverty. While the sense of the greatness of 
Christ is larger, the ability to bring men into lov- 
ing, saving touch with Him sometimes seems less. 
The men at His disposal are many, but the Church 
lacks energy to send them forth. Money is more 
freely given than ever, and yet the greater part of 
the possessions of the saints is still retained for 
their own use. The methods are multiplied, and 
yet one cannot help the conviction that many of 
our organizations are fungus growths, sapping the 
Church's life and contributing nothing to her 
fruitfulness. 

We are profoundly conscious of lack. Every- 
where there is a double sense, that of power and 
of paralysis. We have heard the sound of the 
going in the top of the mulberry trees, but the 
wind of God seems to tarry. We saw the flaming 
of the bush among the Welsh mountains a little 
while ago, but we have seen it in England. All 
about us are indifferent masses. We still mourn 
the dearth of conversions, and are painfully con- 
scious of the languishing missionary spirit. 

PEELIMINAEY 13 

Where is the lack? That is a larger question 
than it is the purpose of this book to discuss. 
E'evertheless, I think it may broadly be stated 
that the supreme need of the Church is the realiza- 
tion experimentally of her relationship to God by 
the Holy Spirit. In the interaction of life and 
prayer will be found the secret of power, and the 
realization of fellowship with God will never be 
more than a theory save as prayer becomes a prac- 
tice. I am particularly anxious to write nothing 
censorious or that fails in recognition of all the best 
things still to be found against us. I am pro- 
soundly conscious that there is a great deal of 
prayer on the highest plane. God has His inter- 
cessors everywhere. They are to be found often 
in unexpected places, in men and women who 
have learned the secret, and who by familiar in- 
tercourse with God are channels of blessing to 
men: but the majority of us are not praying. 
While I thank God for the prayers being offered 
I feel that it is of the utmost importance that the 
whole Church should know the secret of prevail- 
ing prayer, not only as a theory, but in practice. 
In the presence of this need the importance of 
our presenting the same petition as the early dis- 
ciples is apparent. That petition must be carefully 
understood. It was a much larger one than we too 
often make it. We minimize its meaning by add- 
ing to its words. They did not say, Lord, teach us 
how to pray, but, " Lord, teach us to pray." A 
great many people know how to pray, but they do 
not pray. The request, Teach us how to pray, 

14 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

would refer simply to the theory. The petition 
" teach us to pray," is of much fuller import and 
includes theory and practice. 

It is interesting to notice the circumstances in 
which the disciples preferred this request. " And 
it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain 
place, that when He ceased, one of His disciples 
said unto Him, Lord, teach us to pray." It is 
hardly possible to read these words without see- 
ing the connection between their request and 
their observation of the Lord. Jesus Himself 
was preeminently a man of prayer, and there is 
no doubt that they had often seen Him at prayer, 
in all probability had heard Him. Although He 
never prayed with them or used of His own 
prayers the same words He used of theirs, yet it 
was clearly manifest to them how much prayer 
meant to Him, and it is as though they had said, 
" We would come into this secret of Thine." It 
was a request arising from their conviction of the 
value of prayer in His life. 

The answer of Jesus was far more comprehen- 
sive than at first sight may appear. Immedi- 
ately He gave them a pattern and a parable. 
The pattern itself was not exhaustive, for it con- 
sisted of the recitation of certain sentences from 
the form of prayer included in His Manifesto. 
He then gave them a parable which taught by 
contrast the readiness of God to hear and an- 
swer. If through importunity, is the answer, 
they could be persuaded to give, how much more 
would God give out of the love of His heart. 

PEELIMINAEY 15 

This pattern and parable, however, constitute 
nothing more than the local, immediate and par- 
tial answer of Jesus to their request. Later He 
gave them much detailed teaching in His paschal 
discourses, and yet not even this final teaching 
exhausted His great and gracious answer. He is 
Himself, in His revelation of the place and power 
of prayer in human life, the supreme answer to 
their request. By the whole fact of incarnation 
and perfect life, of atonement, resurrection and 
perpetual priesthood does Christ answer this pre- 
liminary prayer. 

It is well for us to remember that we are in di- 
rect succession to these disciples, that their re- 
quests are our requests, and His answers to them 
are His answers to us. Making all allowance for 
a distiuguishing between things which differ, be- 
tween matters which pertain to the specific mes- 
sage of the early days of Jesus and matters con- 
nected with the commission under which we 
serve; it still remains true that His essential 
teaching was intended for us as well as for those 
who first heard it. When He stood surrounded 
by that first group of disciples He prayed, and 
in the course of His prayer He said, " Neither 
for these only do I pray, iDut for them also that 
believe on Me through their word." I always 
feel warmly near to the heart of Christ when I 
read these words, for I know that He saw me 
also, and included me in His priestly intercession. 
As there He prayed for us with them, so also in 
all His teaching He spoke to us as to them. 

THE POSSIBILITY OF PRAYER 

* ' Re that comeih to God must believe that He is, and that He is 
a rewarder of them that seek after Him.^^ â€” Hebrews 11: 7. 

^^ If ye abide in 31e, and My words abide in you, ask whatsoever 
ye will, and it shall be done unto you. ' ' â€” John 15: 7. 

" And they continued steadfastly in the Apostles^ teaching and 
fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers,^ ^ â€” Acts 2: 42.

THE POSSIBILITY OF PRAYER 

"While the purpose of the present series of 
studies is that of stating the positive truth of 
the Christian faith concerning prayer, it is neces- 
sary at least to recognize the fact that among the 
things of weakness characterizing our age is a 
far spread doubt of the possibility of prayer. It 
is affirmed that the advance of scientific knowl- 
edge has made it impossible to believe that the 
desires and petitions of individual souls or of 
companies in agreement can have any effect upon 
the affairs of a universe conditioned absolutely 
within law. Some there are, therefore, and those 
the more consistent, who bandon prayer in every 
form, while others urge the maintenance of the 
habit of prayer because of the effect it produces 
upon those who pray. These claim that prayer, 
while devoid of objective value, has yet a sub- 
jective value. It is not my purpose to attempt 
any philosophical discussion on this question. I 
believe that the majority of persons who read 
will concede at once the objective value of prayer, 
and I do not think anything said in defense of 
the theory will bring conviction to those in doubt. 
It is only by praying that the possibility is 
proven. He has proved the objective value of 
prayer who has asked and received, who has 

19 

20 THE PEACTICE OF PKAYER 

sought and found, who has knocked and known 
the door opened in answer. Yet there are cer- 
tain of the simplest things which may be said in 
this connection. 

Let it once be granted that prayer has a sub- 
jective value and it will be difl&cult to escape 
conviction of its objective value. If it be true 
that petition has produced an effect upon charac- 
ter which is uplifting and ennobling, then that 
effect is due to belief in the existence of One 
who hears and is able to grant requests. If there 
be no such possibility, then belief in that which 
is untrue issues in character which is true and 
beautiful. This is unthinkable. All the subjec- 
tive value of prayer has grown out of conviction 
of an objective value. If a man asks for some- 
thing, it is because he believes he can obtain it 
by asking. Once persuade a man that it is im- 
possible for him to receive an answer to his peti- 
tion and he will not persist in asking. Thus will 
the subjective value of prayer be inevitably 
destroyed when the objective value is denied. 
No man will continue to ask if he be once con- 
vinced that his asking has no greater value than 
that it produces an effect upon himself. Every- 
thing which man has observed of the subjective 
value of prayer, of the influence it has produced 
upon character and tone, has been due to pro- 
found conviction of its objective value. Sincere 
and honest men who once deny the objective 
value cease praying, witness such men as Darwin, 
Tyndal, Spencer and Huxley. Their philosophy 

THE POSSIBILITY OF PEAYER 21 

led them to the conclusion that prayer was never 
answered and therefore they properly and hon- 
estly â€” though as we think â€” mistakenly and dis- 
astrously ceased to pray. 

I am not for a single moment denying the sub- 
jective value of prayer. K'o human being has 
ever lived the life of familiarity with the secret 
place without bearing the light and glory of it 
on the face. Those who know what it is to talk 
often with God gain a tone in their talking with 
men which cannot be mistaken. Herein the sub- 
jective value of prayer, but it came out of pro- 
found conviction that when they spoke they 
were heard, when they asked they were answered. 
I believe therefore that the demonstration of the 
subjective value of prayer is presumptive evidence 
of its objective value. 

Our belief, however, in the prevailing power of 
prayer has firmer foundations. It is based first 
of all upon our doctrine of God. We do not be- 
lieve that He is the slave of His own laws. At 
the same time we do not believe in a God who is 
lawless, but law-abiding. His knowledge of all 
law is, however, such as to enable Him in the 
overruling of one law by another so to perform 
what to our limited vision appears to be miracu- 
lous. Our doctrine of God makes us believe that 
it is possible for Him to do in answer to prayer 
that which appears to be contrary to law, but 
which is in reality wrought by the operation of a 
law of which we know nothing in relation to an- 
other law of which we know something. It is 

22 THE PEACTICE OF PRAYIJE 

reasonable that those who deny the possibility of 
prayer always deny the existence of the miracu- 
lous. What is a miracle? The word simply 
means something which surprises, something for 
which we cannot account, i^ow, the only reason 
why men deny the possibility of prayer is that 
j they deny the possibility of things which they 
I cannot understand. That is the meaning of the 
'denial of everything which we call supernatural. 
Our doctrine of God affirms that from the stand- 
point of His existence, of His government, of 
His love, there is nothing supernatural. The 
things which appear to be supernatural to me, 
are natural to Him. Every miracle of the 'New 
Testament and of the Old Testament was a sim- 
ple happening which surprised men who did not 
know all the facts and forces of the universe. 
Those things surprising to finite men were actions 
perfectly natural to God. It is surely time that 
we recognize this. A great many things of which 
our fathers would have spoken as being quite as 
miraculous as anything recorded in the Bible, are 
commonplaces of every-day life to us. We are 
not surprised at the wonders wrought by elec- 
tricity because we have discovered laws of which 
our fathers knew nothing. Yet the increase of 
our knowledge makes us the more ready to de- 
clare that even today we are but children of the 
dawn. The Christian affirmation is that God 
dwells in the light and there is no darkness with 
Him. That which appears to contradict nature 
is in harmony with the whole economy of God, 

THE POSSIBILITY OF PEAYEE 23 

and the work of God within the realm of laws 
higher than those which man has yet discovered. 
It may be objected that law cannot overrule law; 
but experience proves the contrary. I hold a 
book in my hand. The law of gravitation de- 
mands its fall but it remains in my hand because 
of the operation of an overruling law. In all the 
simplest things of life this inter-action of law is 
at work. Now, the Christian doctrine of God 
declares that He sitteth at the center of the uni- 
verse. He rules eternity with His presence. All 
laws are but His thoughts, and He is able to call 
into operation force against force, law against 
law. We therefore believe it is possible for His 
children to go to Him and ask of Him and receive 
from Him things they cannot obtain in any other 
way. Things absolutely impossible to men within 
the realm of the laws they know may become 
possible to them, if they can gain His ear and 
touch His Heart and find the answer of His over- 
ruling power. Once deny that God can answer 
prayer, and He is degraded into a being less than 
His universe, a prisoner in the heart of His own 
creation. 

Again, our belief in the possibility of prayer is 
based upon the declarations of Jesus, and behind 
His declarations there is Himself. If when I ask 
I never have; when I seek I cannot find; when 
I knock no door is opened to me, then either 
Christ was deceived or a deceiver. His teaching 
was most explicit. In this connection one quota- 
tion, perhaps the most remarkable of all, will 

24 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

suffice. " If ye abide in Me, and My words abide 
in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be 
done unto you." A careful examination of that 
passage makes it even more wonderful than ap- 
pears at first sight. The word " ask " may with 
perfect accuracy be rendered " demand as your 
due." No violence will be done to the Lord's 
words if instead of " whatsoever ye will " we read 
" whatsoever ye are inclined to." Yet again, the 
word translated " done," may be changed into 
" generated," and we have here as it seems to me, 
the most stupendous statement regarding prayer 
ever uttered. It makes prayer limitless within 
limits. " If ye abide in Me, and My words abide 
in you," are the limits. Let these be observed, 
then prayer becomes the method of cooperation 
with Deity. The life of true relation to Himself is 
one in which desire harmonizes with the purposes 
of God, and which therefore demands an answer 
which is provided even though the creative force 
of Deity should be employed. If there is no 
answer to prayer, then these are the words of 
One who was deceived, or was a deceiver â€” im- 
possible alternatives despite a thousand new-born 
philosophies. Neither was He deceived, nor a 
deceiver. What He said is true though the 
heavens fall. Heaven and earth may pass away, 
but His word cannot. To deny the possibility of 
prayer is to deny the teaching of Jesus. To deny 
that teaching is to destroy Him. 

Yet once again, we base our belief in the pos- 
sibility of prayer upon the history and experi- 

THE POSSIBILITY OF PEAYER 25 

ence of men. When science makes experience the 
universal test of reality how can men rationally 
exclude the experience of the saints of all ages in 
this matter? They tell us they have asked and 
had; sought and found; knocked and the door 
has been opened. In answer to this it is affirmed 
that they were all perfectly sincere in believing 
so, but they were mistaken. Such a statement 
is a test of patience to which I am not equal. To 
be told that not one or two; but hundreds, thou- 
sands, tens of thousands of human beings, not of 
one age or temperament or geographical posi- 
tion; but in every age, of all temperaments and 
from every clime, though weeks and months and 
years and decades and centuries and millenniums, 
have all been deceived, is to be asked to believe 
something far more incredible than anything 
which Christianity affirms as true. If the testi- 
mony of seers, prophets, psalmists, saints, confess- 
ors and martyrs is all to go for nothing; yet 
may God help me to share their delusion, for it 
has been a glorious delusion and the dynamic by 
which all the best work of the centuries has been 
done. We affirm therefore, our belief in the ob- 
jective value of prayer, first because of our doc- 
trine of God; secondly because of the declara- 
tions of Jesus Christ, and finally because of the 
history and the experience of the saints. 

Yet, let me go one step further. God has been 
reached always through His Son, Jesus Christ. 
Not that men have always understood this, not 
that we perfectly understand it today, but the 

26 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

fact remains that fallen man has always found 
his way to God in prayer through the mystery of 
the mediation of Christ. Now, that is the theme 
we are proposing to follow. The Christian reve- 
lation is that of the constant method by which 
man has been able to pray; by w^hich man has 
asked and received, has sought and found; has 
knocked and found the door opened. So that the 
final proof of the objective value of prayer lies in 
all that Christian economy which we claim 
creates its possibility, and which is to be con- 
sidered. 

THE PLATFORM OF PRAYER 

" No man hath seen God at any time; but the only begotten Son^ 
which is in the bosom of the Father ^ He hath declared Him.^' 
â€”John 1: 18. 

"^e that comethfrom above is above all; he that is of the earth 
is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: He that cometh from 
heaven is above all. What He hath seen and heard, of that He 
beareth witness; and no man receiveth His witness. He that hath 
received His witness hath set His seal to this, that God is true.^^ â€” 
John 3: 31-33. 

'^ 1 am the good Shepherd: the good Shepherd layeth down His life 
for the sheep.…Therefore doth the Father love Me, because 
1 lay down BIy life, that I may take it again. No one taketh it away 
from Me, but I lay it down of 3Tyself. I have power to lay it down, 
and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I 
from My Father."â€” J OKH 10: 11, 17, 18. 

" Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on 3Ie, the 
works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall 
he do: because I go unto the Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask 
in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the 
Son. If ye shall ask Me anything in My name, that will I do." â€” 
John 14: 12-14. 

" And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Com- 
sorter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth: 
whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth Him not, neither 
knoweth Him: ye know Him; for He abideth with you, and shall be 
in you.…But the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom 
the Father will send in My name. He shall teach you all things, and 
bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you." â€” John 14: 
16, 17, 26. 

^^But when the Comforter is come, whom I loill send unto you 
from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the 
Father, He shall bear witness of Me." â€” John 15: 26.

THE PLATFORM OF PRAYER 

IlAViNa considered the subject of the possi- 
bility of prayer generally, we now proceed to 
think of it particularly, and as within the Chris- 
tian fact. In the three groups of Scriptures with 
which this study is prefaced we have indicated 
the threefold fact which creates the possibility of 
prayer according to Christian teaching and ex- 
perience. The selection of verses is not intended 
to be exhaustive. It would be quite possible to 
take other single verses containing the same 
truth in some other setting. It is also self-evi- 
dent that in this study there is no intention of 
dealing exhaustively with the verses selected. I 
propose only to deduce from thera their sugges- 
tiveness on this particular subject of prayer. 

In the first place let me state the general value 
of each group. In the first our Lord is presented 
to us as the One who has revealed the Father. 
In the second He is presented as the One who 
brings us, through His mediatorial work, into the 
presence of the Father that there we may appear 
complete in the Son, and therefore unafraid. In 
the third He is presented to us as the One 
through whose perfect and accomplished work 
the Spirit is given to us to abide with us, to be 
in us. 

29 

30 THE PEAOTICE OF PEAYER 

This threefold fact creates the Christian plat- 
form of prayer. Its first phase is that Christ has 
made such a revelation of the Father as creates 
in our hearts a desire for prayer. The second is 
that He has done such work for us as admits us 
to the presence of God in order that we may 
have the right to pray. While the third is that 
upon the accomplishment of His work and as its 
crowning glory He poured forth His Spirit who 
by indwelling is the inspiration of our prayer as 
we stand in Christ in the presence of that God 
whom Jesus has perfectly revealed. 

The relation of this threefold fact to our 
previous study should be noted. Therein we de- 
clared that we believe prayer to be possible be- 
cause of our doctrine of God. From whence did 
we obtain this doctrine? From Christ's revela- 
tion of the Father. We declared in the second 
place, that we believe prayer to be possible be- 
cause of the teaching of Christ. What was the 
final teaching of Christ in answer to that request 
of His disciples? It was not the teaching of His 
words, but that of His work. The meditation of 
Jesus is His ultimate teaching which brings con- 
viction to our hearts of the possibility of prayer. 
Finally, we declared that we believe in the possi- 
bility of prayer because of the experience of the 
saints. How has that experience been created? 
It has ever been the result of the indwelling and 
inspiration of the Holy Spirit. 

Let us now approach the subject from another 
standpoint, by asking whether prayer is possible 

THE PLATFOEM OF PEAYEE 31 

apart from these truths. I unhesitatingly reply 
that it is not. If they are denied prayer will 
cease sooner or later. There may be prayer in 
some senses apart from a consciousness of these 
things. There is an instinct for prayer in human 
nature which expresses itself among all peoples; 
but prayer, as we understand it, as our fathers 
have experienced it, and as the JSTew Testament 
teaches, is absolutely impossible save on that 
platform. Let us begin with the first fact. Sup- 
pose it were possible to blot out the revelation 
of God which the word has received through 
Jesus Christ. The supposition is of course an 
absurdity. The revelation can never be entirely 
lost. It has become ingrained in the common 
consciousness of the age. Those who deny the 
deity of Jesus and tell us they believe in the 
Fatherhood of God speaking with exquisite 
beauty of that fatherhood, are speaking of that 
which Christ revealed. For the sake of argument, 
however, let us suppose it possible that the world 
should lose that consciousness of God which 
Christ has created, what then would be the result? 
The measure of intellectual progress apart from 
revelation would be the measure in which men 
would cease to pray. It may be objected that 
this is to declare that prayer is not an intellectual 
exercise, but that is not so. When I refer to the 
measure of man's intellectual progress apart from 
revelation I am proposing to omit the quantity 
without which the intellect is at once darkened 
and imprisoned. No man is a full grown intel- 

32 THE PEACTICE OF PRAYEE 

lectual who is not ready to receive revelation. 
To turn the back upon revelation is necessarily 
to cease to pray. Why did Huxley, Tyndal, 
Darwin and Spencer cease to pray? The an- 
swer inevitably is, because they ceased to believe 
in revealed religion; they denied that God had 
revealed Himself to men directly and specifically. 
Some declared that He was unknowable, that it 
was not possible for Him to reveal Himself to 
men or for men to receive any revelation from 
Him. Denying revealed religion, they turned to 
nature and prosecuted their inquiry with absolute 
honesty and splendid devotion. Some of their 
number, as we well know, who in their early 
days possessed a love of poetry and music, lost it 
entirely in their devotion to cold scientific 
investigation. What was their ultimate position? 
They could not pray. And this, because nature 
never reveals that fact concerning God which 
creates desire for prayer. Nature does reveal 
God, but not in all the facts of His Being. What 
can a man find in nature if he shuts the book of 
revelation, and declines to believe that God has 
spoken in His Word or through His Son? The 
Apostle, writing to the Romans, declared that 
God had evidently revealed Himself in nature in 
two particulars, namely in His power and divin- 
ity. The men to whom reference has been made 
declared that they found at the back of all nat- 
ural phenomena an eternal energy. One of 
them spoke of this as " a double-faced somewhat, 
a combination of intelligence and force." I 

THE PLATFOEM OF PEAYEE 33 

accept the testimony of the Apostle and of the 
modern scientist, that you find God in nature as 
force and as intelligence, but to neither of these 
nor to the two in cooperation, is it possible to 
pray. I cannot pray to force. All I can do in 
Its presence is to discover its law and obey it in 
order that I may constrain it to serve me rather 
than to blast me. It is a perpetual law of force 
that It will do the one or the other accordino- to 
the relation which we bear to it. Take dynamite 
as expressive of force. To disobey its law is to 
be scattered by it into fragments. By obedience 
to its law is the rock blasted and the highway 
created. When men would use dynamite they 
do not pray to it. They discover its law. If 
God be only an eternal energy, then I cannot 
pray, but even then I will attempt to discover the 
law of His operation and obey it. During the 
last fifty years man's conception of the divine 
intelligence has been greatly enlarged. As man 
has prosecuted his inquiry and come to under- 
stand more perfectly the marvel of the universe 
m the midst of which he lives, he has come to a 
larger comprehension of the marvel of the all- 
governing intelligence. For instance, there was a 
time when man turned his telescope to the 
heavens and counted the stars. A little later on 
with a more powerful instrument he declared that 
the number was far in excess of that first 
affirmed; until at last Eosse turned his great re- 
fractor to the heavens and declared that the stars 
cannot be counted. That is the scientific posi- 

34 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

tion today. The Bible affirmed it long ago. 
Jeremiah sang that the stars were without num- 
ber, but men declared it was the license of poetry. 
As a matter of fact it was cold, hard, scientific 
fact. To return, however, this scientific investi- 
gation has enlarged man's conception of the in- 
telligence behind nature, and in that proportion 
it has been less easy for man to pray. That may 
sound a strange thing to say, and yet I think it 
must be conceded as true. When I find illimit- 
able intelligence ordering seasons and mar- 
shalling stars I cannot believe that by any asking 
of mine I can hope to affect or persuade such a 
mind. I cannot pray to intelligence. 

But now I read " No man hath seen God at 
any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the 
bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him." 
Here is a new quantity, a new fact, " the bosom 
of the Father." Put this into other words and 
read, " the heart of God." Jesus has revealed 
the fact that God is more than force and intelli- 
gence working in cooperation. He is a personal 
Being, and at the back of the force presiding 
over it, behind the intelligence inspiring it, is 
love. If that be true there is at once born, 
within me a desire to pray. If it be true that 
behind all the rest there is a heart, then I will 
pray in spite of force, and notwithstanding intel- 
ligence. If God is but another name for intelli- 
gence, that intelligence is demonstrated to be so 
stupendous that it is unthinkable and foolish for 
me to attempt to pray to such a mind as that. 

THE PLATFOEM OF PEAYER 35 

Prayer is impossible. I am bruised and broken 
upon life's highway but there is no help for me 
in the inscrutable might and mind of which I am 
conscious. But out of the infinite spaces there 
comes to me a great love song. Out of the bosom 
of the Father comes a message of tenderness and 
compassion. Immediately, bruised and broken 
as I am, 1 want to pray. I desire to speak out 
of my sense of sin and sorrow to the heart be- 
hind force and intelligence concerning my need. 
Agony can sob itself out upon a heart. Impo- 
tence can trust love. A sinner can turn his face 
back towards a Father. ISTeither force nor intelli- 
gence, nor both working in cooperation consti- 
tute God. If that is all a man knows of God 
he will cease to speak of it as God, and presently 
will write the word with a small g, or he will 
simply use the word in accommodation to the age 
in which he lives, not because of its personal sig- 
nificance. Christ has revealed to men the fact 
that the personality behind the universe is force, 
intelligence and heart, a complete personality, not 
only volitional and intellectual but emotional 
withal. While I cannot comprehend Him nor 
encompass Him within my finite thinking, I still 
know that I have found in that infinite concep- 
tion something which perfectly corresponds to 
my finite life. There is something in me of force 
and intelligence, but the greatest of me is my 
heart. "When my finite heart finds the infinite 
heart of God I am able to trust my finite 
strength to His infinite strength, and my finite 

36 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

mind to His infinite intelligence. This then is 
the first fact in the platform of prayer, that the 
God of the universe has a bosom, a heart, and that 
the Son has spoken to men out of it. By the 
way of Jesus Christ there has come to man this 
new revelation concerning God, the revelation of 
His heart, of His essential essence, of His love. 
Out of that revelation is born the passion for 
prayer in the soul of man. 

Yet that fact alone does not make prayer pos- 
sible, neither does it reveal to us the })latform 
upon which we stand to pray. Though I appear 
to contradict what I have already said it must 
be affirmed that in the moment when I stand face 
to face with God as the God of love, even though 
the desire to pray is born within me I am con- 
scious that I dare not pray. When Jesus Christ 
brings me into His presence and I find His love, 
there is immediately in my nature a going out 
after Him; but simultaneousl}^ with the birth of 
desire comes a new consciousness wliich seals ray 
lips. It is when I stand in the presence of God 
as love that I realize for the first time the real 
meaning of sin, and I am silent. This assertion 
may not carry conviction at first, yet think of it! 
The men who have missed the vision of God's 
love have invariably lost their sense of their own 
sin. Those who have lost the God of revelation 
never speak of sin as do those who live in the 
light of revelation. Sin to the former is an in- 
firmity, a weakness, a process of development. 
It has recently been affirmed that this is an age 

THE PLATFOEM OF PEAYEE 37 

in which men of highly developed intelligence 
do not care to think of or speak of sin, but it is 
surely no proof of high development that men 
desire to close their eyes to facts. I repeat, that 
to lose tho vision of God is to lose the sense of 
sin. If I simply think of an eternal energy 
working in response to supreme intelligence, I 
become conscious of my own weakness and my 
own foolishness, but never of my sin. It is when 
I stand in the presence of the heart of God that 
I really begin to know what sin is. To illustrate 
briefly from personal experience. I was born in 
a Christian home, nurtured by Christian parents, 
and by that fact graciously and tenderly spared 
from many of the vulgarities of godlessness. 
Consequently Mount Sinai with its thunder 
never made me tremble, never brought deep con- 
viction of sin to my heart. I have always sym- 
pathized with the young ruler who confronted 
by the six final words of the decalogue, could 
yet look into the face of incarnate purity and 
say, " All these things have I observed from my 
youth." But when I came to stand consciously, 
not at the foot of the mount which might not 
be touched, but on the green hill outside the city 
wall, and saw in the mystery of that passion and 
pain the revelation of the heart of God, the self- 
sacrificing, self-denying heart of God, I knew 
what a sinner I was. When I came into the 
presence of God as love I found in love a light 
which bowed me to the dust in shame, and 
though my sad heart yearned to pray, I dared 

38 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

not take His name upon my lips, for He is love 
ineffable who has â€” let me say it reverently â€” de- 
nied Himself in order to help men. In the light 
of that love I discovered that sin does not consist 
in incidental acts of passing days, but in the es- 
sential attitude of selfishness. It is when Jesus 
brings me into the presence of the heart of God 
that I put my hand upon my lips and cry. Un- 
clean, unclean. I want to pray. I dare not 
pray. I have forfeited all right to ask for any- 
thing from such love. I need yet more than the 
revelation of the Father before I can pray. 
Thank God there is more. 

I pass to the second group of Scriptures and in 
them I find the provision I seek. "I am the 
good Shepherd: the good Shepherd layeth down 
His life for the sheep." Death and resurrection 
are in that sentence. He layeth down His life, that 
is the mystery of His dying. He layeth down His 
life for the sheep, that is, in such a way that it 
becomes communicate to them. " No one taketh it 
away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have 
power to lay it down, and I have power to take 
it again. This commandment received I from 
M}^ Father." Thus in the radiant splendor of 
these words of Jesus I see One who comes out 
from God, lays down His life, and in the mystery 
of that act clears me from sin, who takes His life 
again in resurrection and in the might of that act 
places at my disposal a new life which makes it 
possible for me to stand unafraid in the presence 
of God. All this is exactly what I need. I can- 
not pray unless my sin is forgiven and my dead 

THE PLATFOEM OF PEAYER 39 

spiritual nature is brought to life. Hear me in 
solemn reverence as I speak out of my heart's 
deepest consciousness. I need something done 
for me whereby the pollution of sin can be blotted 
out, if not for God's sake for my own. If you 
could persuade me that God could forgive me 
without all that the Cross means, you could not 
persuade me that I could forgive myself. I must 
have something that cleanses from the pollution 
which spoils and harms and clings to my life. 
Sentimental passion and pity cannot purge the 
stain from my own conscience. In the very deep- 
est of me there is a cry which answers the very 
word of revelation, " Without the shedding of 
blood there is no remission." Ere I can enter the 
presence chamber of the revealed Father and 
pray, I need some mystery of cleansing and heal- 
ing, some new dynamic which should touch and 
quicken into life the withered powers within me. 
I am amazed at the love of God, but I dare not 
pray until the revealing Son stands before me as 
Mediator also. " Who is this that cometh from 
Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this 
that is glorious in His apparel, marching in the 
greatness of His strength?" It is One with 
wounded hands, the mystery of pain written upon 
His face, with all the evidences of the passion of 
sacrificial dying enwrapping Him as with a pur- 
ple robe. Who is He? He is the Son, the good 
Shepherd. The One who came after lost ones. 
The One who found them bruised and broken; 
mangled and torn by wolves. The One who laid 
down His life to rescue them, and yet in such 

40 THE PEACTICE OF PKAYEE 

power as to be able to take it again and com- 
municate it to them so that it became their life. 
The One who by such dying and living has given 
to men of His life the vision, the virtue, the vic- 
tory. It is God Himself acting out in the limita- 
tion of time and sense and flesh that infinite mys- 
tery of love saving through sacrifice. Thus it is 
through the rent veil of His flesh that I enter the 
place of prayer. It is through the mystery of 
His accomplished work that I dare to draw near. 
I who had felt the moving of God's heart as Jesus 
spake and taught and yet was made afraid 
thereby because of sin, am now brought near by 
the mystery of mediation and in the presence of 
God I dare to pray, standing unafraid in the light 
of God's love in the merit and might of the death 
and resurrection of His Son. 

And yet once again, I cannot pray. The love 
of God revealed has made me desire to pray. 
The work of Jesus as Mediator has brought me 
into the place of prayer, but I was never more 
afraid to pray than now. That is the meaning 
of the Apostolic declaration, " We know not how 
to pray as we ought." For who are these of 
whom he thus speaks? They are the people 
whose experience is described in the chapter which 
commences with " no condemnation," and ends 
with " no separation." There is surely no time in 
which a man feels less able to pray than when 
having seen the vision of God through Jesus, and 
having been made nigh by Jesus to God, he stands 
in the place where he is free to pra}^ The nearer 
we live to the heart of Jesus, and the closer we 

THE PLATFOEM OP PEAYEE 41 

abide in the consciousness of God's love the less 
shall we feel able to pray. We sometimes sing 

The weakest, feeblest need the most 
The praying in the Holy Ghost. 

That is a great truth, and yet I think it may be 
written in another way, 

The strongest, mightiest need the most 
The praying in the Holy Ghost. 

That is to say those who have answered the reve- 
lation of love by absolute abandonment to the 
mediating Son; those who have entered most 
perfectly into the experience of the Divine pro- 
vision, need most sorely a true inspiration, and 
are the most acutely conscious of their need. To 
stand in the presence of such love by such grace 
is to shrink back lest by some impurity of motive 
or faultiness of desire prayer should become un- 
worthy. 

Thus we are brought to the third fact in the 
provision for prayer, that was dealt with in the 
final discourses of Jesus when He promised the 
Comforter. The indwelling Spirit interprets to 
us the meaning of the life we live and gives us to 
see the will of God in Jesus, and the way in 
which we must act in order to realize that will. 
The indwelling Spirit who knows the will of God 
creates our new aspirations and desires, and out 
of these comes our prayer. Thus standing in the 
light of the revealed Father through the media- 
tion of His Son and answering the inspiration of 
the indwelling Spirit we pray. 

In conclusion let these thoughts be summarized. 

42 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

By the coming of Jesus God has been so revealed 
as to create the desire for prayer. By the work 
of Jesus mediation has been made which brings 
man into the place of prayer. By the indwelling 
of Jesus by the Spirit desires are created and 
choices are made which express themselves in 
prayer. Thus through the mercy of the Father, 
the merit of the mediating Son, and the might of 
the inspiring Spirit, prayer is possible. That con- 
ception of the platform of prayer must have an 
effect upon our praying. If we lack that vision we 
shall pray ignorantly and foolishly. We shall 
ask and have not because we ask amiss. If once 
that platform of prayer be recognized and we un- 
derstand to whom, and through whom and by 
whom we pray, our praying will become prevail- 
ing. The whole truth may be constantly remem- 
bered by the Apostolic benediction, " The grace 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, 
and the communion of the Holy Spirit." The 
only difference is that in this benediction we com- 
mence with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ 
and then pass to that infinite fountain, the love 
of God, and finally refer to that abiding fellow- 
ship, the communion of the Holy Spirit. " The 
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ," " though He was 
rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye 
through His poverty might become rich." That 
is the story of mediation. " The love of God," 
that is the whole word of Christ's revelation. 
" The communion of the Holy Spirit," that is the 
fact of the Spirit's indwelling and inspiration. 

THE PREPARATION FOR PRAYER 

** Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father* s good pleasure to 
give you the Kingdom." â€” Luke 12: 32. 

' ' But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wis- 
dom from God, and righteousness and sanctificaiion, and redemp- 
tion." â€” 1 COEINTHIANS 1: 30. 

' ' For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in 
pain together until now. And not only so, but ourselves also, 
which have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan 
within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, to wit, the i-edemption 
of our body. For by hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is 
not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeih? But if we 
hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. 
And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we 
know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit Himself maketh 
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; and 
He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is in the mind of the 
Spirit, because He m,aketh intercession for the saints according to 
the will of God. And we know that to them that love God all 
things work together for good, even to them that are called accord- 
ing to His pMrpose."â€” Romans 8: 23-28. 

IV 

THE PREPARATION FOR PRAYER 

Let me at once clear the ground by making 
plain what I do not mean by preparation for 
prayer. In this title there is no reference to any 
preparation which is occasional and special. For 
such preparation there will be no necessity in 
proportion as the larger preparation of the life 
is assured. It is a great question whether the 
attitude of mind which demands some recall and 
readjustment in order to public or private prayer 
is at any time one which is honoring to our 
Lord and Master. I am perfectly well aware 
that this is a somewhat startling statement, and 
I appeal for a careful consideration of the subject 
now to be dealt with that the truth concerned, 
may be ascertained. In the meantime I do most 
confidently affirm that it ought to be a perfectly 
natural and easy thing to turn from work or play 
to prayer at any time or in any place, and more- 
over, it seems to me increasingly, as days pass on 
that any work or play which makes that sponta- 
neous prayer impossible should be abandoned at 
all costs and once for all. As to private prayer, 
believing as I do in its required constancy I can- 
not also believe in the necessity for any process 
of preparation. As to public prayer, an illustra- 
tion will express in the simplest way my entire 

45 

46 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

feeling on the subject. Some few years ago in a 
certain city in England, which shall be nameless, in 
preparation for special services I met the minis- 
ters and workers in conference. In the course of 
an address to them I said that I should be very 
glad if my brethren in the ministry would be on 
the platform with me and be ready to lead in 
prayer as they were asked. At the close of the 
meeting one minister came to me and said, " I 
should be so glad if you think of asking me to 
pray if you will let me know the day before so 
that I may be prepared." I replied, " If I want 
you to pray I will let you know the day before." 
I never asked him to pra}^. Some may object to 
this, believing that a man ought to have time to 
prepare to pray on such an occasion. I can only 
say for myself that the kind of preparation which 
has been very largely followed in any such case 
has in my judgment wrought wide-spread harm. 
At many of our great ecclesiastical gatherings, 
prayers are heard which are perfect literary pro- 
ductions, but which lack the passion and power 
which prevail. Consequently I am not dealing 
with the subject of how to prepare for prayer 
upon some special occasion. _If we learn the 
deep secrets of prayer we shall be able to pray 
?inywhen and anywhere. We shall fulfill the in- 
junctions of the ^N'ew Testament which startle 
us â€” Christ's injunction, "Men ought always to 
pray," and the Apostolic injunction, " Pray with- 
out ceasing." Too often our method of dealing 
with such texts is a revelation of our unprepared- 

THE PEEPAEATION FOE PEAYEE 47 

ness for prayer. We say Christ did not really 
mean that men ought always to pray. He meant 
that they ought to pray as often as they can. He 
meant nothing of the kind. When He said, 
"Men ought always to pray," He meant it. 
When the Holy Spirit speaking through the 
Apostle said '* Pray without ceasing," He meant 
it. If we can but learn the true secret of prep- 
aration we shall find that our whole life becomes 
prayer, that it will be impossible for us to write 
a letter without a lifting of the heart to God for 
guidance. I am inclined to think that the more 
we know of real prayer the less time we may 
spend in the external and apparent exercise 
thereof. 

I am speaking then of the preparation which 
touches life, and so makes us ready for prayer at 
all times. Having thus attempted to clear the 
ground let me proceed. I propose first to put 
the whole statement into one brief sentence, and 
then examine that sentence in detail. The whole 
case then may thus be stated. 

Preparation for prayer is secured by response 
in the life to the great facts which make prayer 
possible. 

That I maintain is the inclusive philosophy of 
preparation for prayer. Now let us examine that 
statement. First of all it must be remembered 
that all truth is a light which reveals a pathway 
in which man must walk. Truth always sets up 
a claim, makes a demand. It is never merely a 
commodity which can be stored and labeled and 

48 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

shelved. A man cannot hold truth. Truth must 
hold the man. Immediately truth presents itself 
to a life it makes a demand upon that life. While 
that is so in regard to all truth it is preeminently 
the case in regard to spiritual truth. Every truth 
of the Christian faith taken hold of by the mind 
makes a call upon the will. In proportion as 
that claim is answered the life is sanctified. I 
hold the truth which holds me. Take that prin- 
ciple and apply it to this subject of prayer. We 
have seen that the platform of prayer consists of 
the threefold fact of the revelation of the Father, 
the mediation of the Son, the inspiration of the 
Spirit. I am prepared for prayer in proportion 
as I obey the claims set up upon my life by the 
revelation of the Father; in proportion as I yield 
myself to the claims made upon my life by the 
mediation of the Son; in proportion as my life 
answers the claims set up within me by the 
Spirit's indwelling and inspiration. I see the 
truth about God revealed in Jesus and that truth 
makes claims upon me. If I answer them I am 
by such answer prepared for prayer. I am 
brought into the place where I see the truth con- 
cerning Christ's great mediatorial work. If I 
answer the claim that truth makes upon me I am 
prepared for prayer. I see the truth concerning 
the Spirit's method of making intercession. If I 
answer that indwelling illumination, yield myself 
to it, refuse to quench, or resist or grieve the 
Spirit, and allow my life to be borne along by 
the great currents of the river of God, I shall 

THE PEEPAKATIO:^^ FOE PEAYER 49 

be prepared to pray, bound to pray, and shall al- 
ways pray. In other words, preparation for 
prayer is the life lived in harmony with the truth 
we profess to believe. It is not spasmodic, occa- 
sional; but lies rather in the preparation of the 
life itself and in proportion as we are living as 
we ought to live, we not only want to pray, we 
are able to pray: we not only want to pray and 
are able to pray, but we do pray, and that so as 
to prevail. 

Let us consider this more particularly by ap- 
plication of the principle in the case of the pre- 
vious study, our platform of prayer. We saw it 
to be of threefold significance, including the rev- 
elation of the Father, the mediation of the Son, 
the inspiration of the Spirit. If it be true that 
we are prepared for prayer as we respond to the 
great truths suggested by those words, we now 
have to ask ourselves, " What is the revelation of 
the Father; what the mediation of the Son; 
what the inspiration of the Spirit? " We need 
to examine these things in order to find out how 
far we are responsive to them, how far we are 
obedient, so that thus we may find out how far 
we are really prepared for prayer. Such ques- 
tions, of course, finally involve the study of the 
whole of Christian doctrine: but for our present 
practical purpose a less comprehensive inquiry 
will suffice. I have therefore selected the pas- 
sages with which this study is prefaced, not to 
consider the specific teaching of each passage, but 
because they contain light which will help us. 

50 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

Take the first of them, " Fear not, little flock; 
for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you 
the Kingdom." These are the actual words of 
Jesus. I am not dealing with the message of en- 
couragement they contain, great and gracious as 
it is and having some bearing on our subject of 
prayer, as it has. I desire rather to look at the 
verse from a purely literary standpoint, and in so 
doing we find that Jesus recognizes all the 
essential truth concerning God which He came to 
reveal to man. Sometimes in ordinary conversa- 
tion a very general statement will reveal the 
speaker's whole philosophy on a certain subject. 
When Jesus uttered these words He was not in- 
tending to make a revelation of the Father, but 
His conception of God flashes forth in great 
clearness and beauty. If such a statement ap- 
peared in a press issue from the pen of a modern 
author, a merely literary critic might be tempted 
to find a great deal of fault with it. I can im- 
agine him saying, " Our author has fallen into a 
strange mixture of metaphors. He begins, ' Fear 
not, little flock,' and the figure in his mind is 
evidently that of the shepherd and his sheep; 
but forgetting this, he continues, ' it is your 
Father's good pleasure,' showing that he has 
already mixed the figure of the shepherd and the 
sheep with that of the father and the family; and 
again immediately he seems to have forgotten the 
previous figures as he continues * to give you the 
Kingdom.' " We know perfectly that the meta- 
phors of Jesus never clash. In this saying there 

THE PEEPAEATION FOR PEAYER 51 

is a perfect unfolding of all the truth concerning 
God which Jesus came to teach man. He is re- 
vealed as the Shepherd, Father, King. The 
picture suggested is purely Eastern, and there can 
be no doubt that in many respects, Eastern con- 
ditions explain fundamental positions far more 
clearly than many of our Western methods do. 
In the Arab tribe the Sheik is at once shepherd 
of the jflock, father of the family and king of the 
nation. In those figures as Jesus used them He 
takes us back to the original ideal of government. 
Through the picture of the ancient economy He 
reveals the eternal verities of which the material 
things are but the shadow upon time's surface. 
We must remember that these words were spoken 
to His own. When He addresses those outside 
He calls them first to submission to the Kingship 
of God. No man ever found God as Father until 
He recognized Him as King. In speaking to His 
own the Master begins with the thought of the 
Shepherd, then passes to that of the Father, and 
finally to that of the King. At the heart of the 
revelation is the thought of the Fatherhood. We 
shall see that more clearly when we come to deal 
with the pattern prayer, the whole of which is 
addressed to the Father, the first half asking for 
the setting up of the Kingdom, and the last for 
the care and provision of the Shepherd. I^one of 
these things were new. There is nothing in the 
Gospels which had not been said in the Scriptures 
of the old economy. Yet everything He said was 
new. Men had said, "The Lord is my Shep- 

52 THE PEAOTICE OF PEAYEE 

herd " for ages, but when He said " I am the 
good Shepherd " men understood as they had 
never done before. In the midst of trouble, men 
had constantly sung "Like as a father pitieth his 
children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear 
Him," but when Jesus said " Your Father know- 
eth," He revealed the meaning of Fatherhood far 
more perfectly than the song which spoke of His 
pity merely. Men had recognized Jehovah as 
King, but Jesus came to reveal the meaning of 
His Kingship. Nothing was new. Everything 
was new. The old things blossomed into new 
beauty such as humanity had never dreamed of. 
It is only in proportion as we answer the 
claims of this revelation that we are prepared for 
prayer. As we are loyal to the King, like unto 
the Father, content with the provision of the 
Shepherd, we are ready to pray. All this is 
surely self-evident. How can we pray "Thy 
Kingdom come," if we are rebelling against the 
King? How is it that our prayer so often fails 
to prevail? Because we persist in praying, quite 
honestly, " Thy Kingdom come " and yet in our 
own heart we are not submissive to the King. 
Something in the life is permitted which is con- 
trary to His will; something in the business, the 
friendships, the amusements. It is a solemn, yet 
awful truth that we blaspheme when we pray for 
the Kingdom to come and will not permit it to 
obtain in our own life. It is an infinitely worse 
thing that I should pray for God's Kingdom to 
come in the world while I refuse to allow it to be 

THE PEEPAEATION FOE PEAYEE 53 

set up in my heart, than it is to take His name in 
vain because I was born in a slum and had never 
learned to revere it. If prayer is not prevailing in 
our experience it is not because some scientific 
teacher has denied its possibility, but rather be- 
cause we are not responding to the revelation. 
Of the significance of the Shepherd I would speak 
in all tenderness. It is when I am resting in my 
Shepherd's provision that I am able to pray. If 
I am rebellious against my lot and persist in look- 
ing upon my work as drudgery, I cannot pray. 
It is the heart at leisure from itself because per- 
fectly content with the Shepherd's provision, 
that is able to pray. If I can truly say that 
where'er my Shepherd leads I am content be- 
cause He leads; if through the desert, I am glad, 
for that is best if 'tis His Will; or if He leads by 
waters still, I sing, not because the waters are 
still and the pastures green, but because He 
leads; then I am able to pray. I pray God to 
teach me that. 

Jesus revealed God as Father. This fact is 
central and final. How do we respond to it? A 
child responds to fatherhood when it reproduces 
the father's likeness. That is something infinitely 
beyond loyalty to Kingship, or content with pas- 
ture. The child inherits his father's nature. If 
I am a child of God I inherit my Father's nature. 
The proportion in which I yield myself thereto 
until it manifests itself through me is the meas- 
ure of my power to pray. One illustration must 
suffice. How can we hope to pray so as to pre- 

54 THE PEAOTICE OF PRAYEE 

vail while we call ourselves children of God, and 
yet nurse in our hearts bitterness and malice 
which are unlike God? It is only when God's 
nature of love rules and reigns and inspires all 
our life, that we shall want to pray, and that our 
praying will prevail. To use the terminology of 
the praying man, is not to pray. To have the 
revelation and to answer it in loyalty to the 
King, in contentment with the provision of the 
Shepherd, in the reproduction of the Father's 
likeness, that is to pray. 

Take a step further and consider the response 
of the soul to the fact of Christ's mediation. In 
his letter to the Corinthian Christians Paul had 
been contrasting the wisdom of men's words with 
the wisdom of the Word of the Cross. Assuring 
them that our Gospel, while a message of foolish- 
ness to the Greeks is not devoid of wisdom, in a 
comprehensive statement he declares what that 
wisdom is, " Of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who 
was made unto us wisdom from God, and right- 
eousness, and sanctification and redemption.'' 
Whether wisdom, righteousness, sanctification 
and redemption are separate and differing as- 
pects of our Lord's work in the believer, or 
whether righteousness, sanctification and redemp- 
tion are but the apostle's analysis of wisdom, the 
one all-inclusive word, appears to me immaterial, 
though personally I hol^ the latter interpreta- 
tion. Christ is wisdom, and this wisdom of God 
is manifest in righteousness, sanctification and 
redemption. These three words cover the whole 

THE PEEPAEATION FOE PEAYEE 55 

fact of Christ's mediatorial work. They reveal 
the tenses of the Christian life. These tenses are 
indicated by three great words, righteousness, 
sanctification, redemption. The past tense of 
salvation is that experience to which I look back. 
When I believed Christ was imputed to me as 
rifirhteousness. That was the salvation of my 
spirit. The present tense of salvation is that 
process through which I am now passing. Christ 
is being imparted to me as sanctification. That 
is the salvation of my mind. The future tense 
of salvation is the life which is nearer than when 
I believed. Christ will be implanted in me as 
redemption. That is the salvation of my body. 
The word translated redemption is always used 
with regard to the coming glory. The same 
word occurs in the letter to the Romans, " Even 
we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for 
our adoption, to wit, the redemption of our 
body." Of course, it will be understood that I 
do not mean that the English word redemption is 
always used of the coming glory, but that the 
Greek word so translated is always used in this 
sense. It is most important that we should grasp 
this threefold idea of our salvation. It consists 
in Christ imputed as righteousness, imparted as 
sanctification, implanted as glorification. I was 
saved in the essential fact of my being, my spirit, 
when in answer to my faith Christ was imputed 
to me as the righteousness of God. I am being 
saved in mind or consciousness as Christ through 
all the discipline of the present life is being im- 

56 THE PEACTIOE OF PEAYEE 

parted to me as sanctification. I shall be saved 
finally when my body shall be fashioned anew in 
the likeness of His glorious beauty, when Christ 
shall be implanted within me and manifest 
through me. Through the mediatorial work of 
Jesus righteousness is made mine, sanctification 
is being made mine, redemption in its perfection 
will yet be made mine, j 

If we are to pray we must answer the claims 
of these truths. How am I to answer the claims 
of righteousness? By yielding myself to God as 
one alive from the dead. In proportion as I do ^ 
that I am prepared for prayer. The dynamic of 
prayer is holiness, which is rectitude of charac- 
ter, and righteousness, which is rectitude of con- 
duct. Kectitude of conduct can only grow out of 
rectitude of character. Eectitude of character is 
given to me potentially when Christ is imputed 
to me. My responsibility is that I yield myself 
as one alive from the dead to Jesus Christ for 
righteousness. How am I to respond to sanctifi- 
cation? Sanctification is the imparting of Christ 
to me, grace for grace. That is to say, every 
grace which is in Him, is in Him for me, and my 
responsibility is that I appropriate day by day 
what He communicates in order that He may re- 
produce Himself in me. ' When in order that I 
may be more perfectly conformed to His image, 
the indwelling Christ calls me to some new duty, 
some new sacrifice, some new enterprise, I must 
answer with ready consent. If I do, prayer pre- 
vails. If I refuse, prayer becomes impossible. 

THE PEEPAEATION FOE PEAYEE 57 

Finally, what response can I make today to the 
future tense of my life in Christ? Dr. James 
Denney in his book on Thessalonians says, " The 
attitude of expectation is the bloom, as it were, 
of the Christian character. Without it there is 
something lacking. The Christian who does not 
look onward and upward wants one mark of 
perfection. This is in all probability the point on 
which we should find ourselves most from home 
in the atmosphere of the Christian Church. Not 
unbelievers only, but disciples as well, have 
practically ceased to think of the second ad- 
vent.…Yet a truth so clearly a part of 
Scripture teaching cannot be neglected without 
loss." I believe that to be most important truth. 
We have been so afraid of being called other- 
worldly, that we have not cared even to sing 
hymns about heaven. It is a grave mistake. 
We have been so afraid that some one would 
name us star-gazers, that we have abandoned all 
speech concerning the second advent. Yet the 
only light that we can ever shed upon the dark- 
ness of the world must be light beaming from 
the face lifted towards God's tomorrow. In the 
matter of prayer this is of supreme importance. 
To pray with prevailing power there must be the 
vision of the morning breaking in the Eastern 
sky. It is the man who sees the coming glory 
who knows what it is to put blood and sacrifice 
into the business of establishing that Kingdom 
here. In order to pray prevailingly, I must live 
in the power of the hope that maketh not 

68 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

ashamed, having my face ever lifted towards the 
light while I yet look at the sorrow around me, 
and serve diligently the will of my King. 
TOnce again, there must be response to the 
Spirit. I am not now proposing to deal with the 
, ^. . / whole of the Spirit's work, but with that whereby 
'^I, <^ ^ He creates intercession. I would suggest three 
words as helpful in following the line of thought. 
They are, interpretation, consciousness, desire. 
The Spirit of God indwelling interprets. His 
interpretation creates a consciousness. That con- 
sciousness creates a desire, and that is prayer. 

/ Prayer is the soul's sincere desire 
Uttered or unexpressed; 
The motion of a hidden fire 
That trembles in the breast. 

The indwelling Spirit knows the will of God and 
interprets it to the soul in whom He abides. 
This He does by unveiling Christ, who is the 
revelation of the will of God to hs^.J As He was 
the Word of God incarnate. He was the will of 
God incarnate. I come to Him that I may see 
what is God's will for myself and for all men; 
that I may understand what is God's purpose 
concerning the whole world. TAs we look out 
upon the movements of the hour and upon all 
the facts of life, the indwelling Spirit sets them 
in relation to the will of God, and a keen con- 
sciousness is born within us of the failure in the 
midst of which we live. Thus the Spirit makes 
intercession in us with groaning which cannot be 

THE PEEPAEATION FOE PEAYEE 59 

uttered as He gives us this new consciousness of 
the limitation and paralysis of all life without 
GodJ As the Spirit interprets to us the will of 
God, He shows the disaster of being out of 
harmony with that will. As the Spirit interprets 
the will of God, therefore. He makes the soul 
profoundly discontented with everything that is 
contrary thereto, and this because of the soul's 
supreme content with the good and perfect and 
acceptable will of God. That is what the apostle 
meant when he wrote, "The whole creation 
groaneth and travaileth in pain together until 
now. And not only so, but ourselves also, which 
have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we our- 
selves groan within ourselves." Faber sang this 
sublime and overwhelming truth in simplest 
words, " Earth's sorrows are most keenly felt in 
heaven." The heavenly people are, therefore, 
those who most acutely feel earth's sorrows and 
are able to enter into fellowship with God in 
prayer for the winning of the victories of His 
love. Following consciousness of discontent is 
that of desire for the coming of the Kingdom, for 
the setting up of the will of God, which means 
the healing of wounds and the breaking of chains. 
To that work of the indwelling Spirit there 
must be ready response. " Quench not the Spirit." 
When the Spirit interprets the will of God for 
life, for home, for city, for nation, we must listen 
to no other philosophy, be seduced by no other 
ideal. As the glories of that Kingdom flame 
and flash before us, we must never be turned 

60 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

aside by the glamor of the things of the world, 
the flesh and the devil. Answer the Spirit. Let 
Him teach. Let Him show the vision. Believe 
the Spirit. " Quench not the Spirit." 

But more, infinitely more. When the Spirit 
revealing the will of God for the world creates in 
the heart a great pain and a great discontent, do 
not let us check it. That is what Christian men 
and women, alas, are too constantly doing. When 
the story of the sin and sorrow of humanity is 
told, they close their ears and are not willing to 
share in the pain. That is to grieve the Spirit 
indeed. We ought to hear. We ought to know. 
We ought to be ready to bring the new sensi- 
tiveness of our Christian life into close touch 
with the world's agony until we feel its pain as 
our very own. The Spirit desires that we should 
know its sorrow. His work is to interpret to us 
the meaning of the sob and sigh and the agony 
of the world. When we feel that, there will 
spring out of our life a new desire which will 
drive us to prayer that God's Kingdom may 
come, and to self-sacrificing service without which 
such prayer is blasphemy. Thus we shall begin 
to sob with God and to God, in our sense of the 
world's sorrow. Out of such prayer the toil and 
travail come which bring the Kingdom in. 

Thus it will be seen that preparation for prayer 
is no slight, spasmodic process. It is the supreme 
matter of life. < Yet, thank God, we can, if we 
will, respond to this revelation, mediation and 
inspiration so as to pray with prevailing power. 

THE PLANE OF PRAYER 
(a) The Purpose of God 

" Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be TJiy name. Thy 
Kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.' ^â€” - 
Matthew 6: 9, 10. 

THE PLANE OF PRAYER 

(a) The Purpose of God 

We now come to the consideration of the plane 
upon which prayer is operative, the subjects con- 
cerning which we have authority to pray. This 
plane is revealed in the pattern prayer as it oc- 
curs in the Manifesto of the King. 

Some few preliminary words are necessary. I 
find there are some who object to the use of this 
prayer by Christian people. I have for a long 
time been endeavoring quite honestly to under- 
stand the position of such, and I think the ob- 
jections which they raise may be briefly stated. 
First, there are those who do not use this prayer 
because they say its petition for forgiveness is not 
the Christian petition. They affirm that we have 
no need now to ask for the forgiveness of our 
debts on the basis of having forgiven our debtors. 
My answer to such is that they certainly do not 
understand the real meaning of this prayer, or 
else they do not understand themselves. Their 
objection, however, will best be dealt with when 
we come to the more particular consideration of 
that petition in the second part of the prayer. 
Others do not use the prayer because they de- 
clare they have no sins to confess or ask forgive- 
ness for. Again, I can only say all such either 
63 

64 THE PEACTIOE OF PEAYEE 

do not understand the meaning of the words 
" debts " and " debtors," or else they are wof ully 
self-deceived. Perhaps the most serious and in- 
telligent objection is that of those who say that 
this prayer was part of the Messianic Manifesto, 
that it had to do with Christ's teaching regard- 
ing the Kingdom, and that therefore it is the 
prayer of the Kingdom and not the prayer of 
the Church. I carefully distinguished between 
the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of heaven, and 
the Church of Jesus Christ, but I do not propose 
to discuss these distinctions now. I recognize 
that the Church is, according to l^ew Testament 
teaching, a separate entity having as its final 
purpose a vocation in the ages to come in the 
heavenly places. While that is perfectly true 
and should never be forgotten, indeed must not 
be forgotten, it is also true that for the present 
hour all the principles of the Kingdom are commit- 
ted to the Church to be realized within the Church 
and through the Church manifested to the world. 
Consequently everything that Jesus said in His 
Manifesto concerning the Kingdom does apply to 
the Church. As a matter of fact that Manifesto 
of the King does not apply at all to the outside 
world. For the present day its only application 
is to the Church. That is another point which I 
do not propose now to elaborate. It is sufiicient 
for the present purpose to say that to attempt to 
bring about the conditions described in the great 
Manifesto of the King among the vast unregen- 
erate masses of the people is inevitably to be 

THE PLANE OF PEAYER 65 

doomed to disappointment. The things which 
Jesus said to His disciples, I maintain, are only 
applicable to those who are in His Kingdom and 
subject to His rule. That Manifesto was the 
enunciation of the ethic of the Kingdom which 
no man can accept or obey while he is still in re- 
bellion against the King Himself. That is a 
broad and hurried statement; but if it be ac- 
cepted it will be seen that in the Church which 
for this age, according to the purpose of Jesus, 
embodies the principles of the Kingdom and 
manifests them in the world this prayer has its 
rightful place. The supreme answer to objec- 
tions to its use will be found in an understanding 
of the prayer itself. In proportion as we really 
comprehend its intention, its spaciousness, its 
magnificence we shall be compelled to use it. 
There can be no escape from the use of it for 
such as are submitted to the reign and Lordship 
of Jesus Christ and are in sympathy with Him 
in His desires for the world. 

Yet another word by way of introduction. It 
has been affirmed and correctly so, that this is 
not a new prayer. Its every petition is to be 
found in the Talmudio writings. We are not 
familiar with these writings, and so the different 
petitions of the prayer are known to us only 
through the Christian use of them. There can 
be little doubt, however, that the men who 
heard the Master when He first gave them the 
prayer were familiar with all its petitions. In all 
probability they had used them constantly in 

66 THE PEACTICE OP PEAYER 

their worship from childhood up. Now, while 
that is true, it is also true that the prayer was 
absolutely new as it came from the lips of Jesus. 
He gathered together the things with which they 
were most familiar and placed them in such per- 
sect relation to each other as to reveal as never 
before the whole plane of prayer. To pray that 
prayer intelligently is to have nothing else to 
pray for. It may be broken up, each petition 
may be taken separately and expressed in other 
ways, but in itself it is inclusive and exhaustive. 
The Jewish Eabbis taught the people what were 
known as " index prayers." These consisted of a 
collection of brief sentences, each one of which 
suggested a subject of prayer. One of their 
habits of praying was to take such an index 
prayer, recite one petition at a time, and elabo- 
rate it in the presence of God by carrying out its 
thought; and endeavoring to express its full in- 
tent. In that sense the Lord's prayer also is an 
" index prayer." There can be no desire of the 
human heart which is inspired of the Holy Spirit, 
no petition presented to the throne of the Father 
but that it is included in this prayer. The King 
wove together all the essential petitions which lay 
scattered over the field of human praying into 
one perfect whole which covers the ground and 
reveals to men for evermore the plane upon 
which they may pray. Thus it is a pattern 
prayer. 

Turning to examination I shall ask you first of 
all to notice its structure. I am so increasingly 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 67 

convinced of the value of eye-gate that I want 
you. to look at the prayer in this form â€” 

Our Father which art in the heavens, 
Thy name be hallowed, 
Thy Kingdom come, 
Thy will be done 

as in heaven so on earth. 
Give us this day our daily bread. 

And 
Forgive us our debts as we also have 
forgiven our debtors. 
And 
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us 
from evil. 

You will notice first that the doxology with 
which the prayer closes is omitted. I suppose 
most of us felt some kind of a pang when, taking 
up the Kevised Version, we found it absent. Yet 
there can be no question as to the accuracy of the 
omission. Even so conservative and scholarly an 
expositor as Hengstenberg says concerning this 
doxology that there is no doubt that it ought to 
be omitted. He goes on to say that so perfect an 
ending to the prayer had better be retained and 
made perpetual use of. I have great sympathy 
with the sentiment of that view, but it cannot be 
permitted in any strict dealing with the Scrip- 
ture. Personally I should never think of using 
the prayer without the doxology, but I should 
ever remember that the doxology was the answer 
of man to the inspired prayer rather than a part 
thereof. Now let us notice the structure of the 
prayer as I have attempted to set it out. The 
whole is introduced by an invocation â€” 

68 THE PEACTIOE OF PEAYER 

Our Father which art in the heavens. 

This invocation prepares the way not for the first 
three petitions only, but for the whole prayer. 
It is a reverent form of address, and by the use 
of it we are brought into the presence of the re- 
vealed Father. 

Beyond the invocation the prayer falls into two 
I parts. The first consists of three petitions with 
I a qualifying phrase; the second consists of three 
' petitions. 

Let us look at the first three petitions, and the 
relation to them of the qualifying phrase. 

Thy name be hallowed, 
Thy Kingdom come, 
Thy will be done 

as in heaven so on earth. 

It is not " Thy will be done on earth as it is in 
f heaven." The final phrase refers to all the peti- 
tions, and not merely to the last. The first half 
of the prayer is therefore one in which we ask 
that God's name may be hallowed, that His King- 
dom may come, that His will may be done on this 
earth as in heaven. The three petitions form one 
whole petition. They mark stages in develop- 
ment. The first stage is the hallowing of the 
Name. That is followed necessarily by the crown- 
ing of the King and the coming of the Kingdom. 
When the King is crowned and the Kingdom es- 
tablished it is demonstrated amongst men by the 
doing of the will of the King by those who have 
hallowed His Name, and in whom the Kingdom 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 69 

is established. Thus the first half of the prayer 
has to do wholly with the purposes of God for 
the world. In some senses all my need is in- 
eluded in this first half. It is not expressed there. 
The only thing expressed is the passion for the 
gaining of God's victory. 

In the second half we have again three peti- 
tions â€” 

Give ns thi3 day our daily bread. 

And 
Forgive us our debts, as we also 
have forgiven our debtors. 
And 
Bring us not into temptation, but 
deliver us from evil. 

Notice the position of the " and " in this setting, 
how it links the second petition with the first, and 
the third with the second. Notice also carefully 
that the phrase " Bring us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil," is not two petitions but 
one. We are constantly hearing of the seven pe- 
titions of the Lord's prayer. There are only six, 
and to make two petitions of the sixth is to create 
difficulties which cannot be explained. Taken as 
one it is a perfect petition, expressive at once of 
the soul's caution and the soul's courage. 

These last three petitions have to do wholly 
with human and temporal needs as the three first 
have to do with the Divine and eternal interests. 
We shall not pray these last three petitions when 
we get to heaven. I think the saints there are 
still praying the first three. I think, moreover, 
that they will continue to pray them until the 

70 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

work is perfected, and that is not yet. Before 
turning to fuller consideration of the first half of 
this wonderful prayer, it is important to notice 
that in its very structure there is teaching. Jesus 
said, " Seek ye first His Kingdom, and His right- 
eousness; and all these things shall be added unto 
you." That was His order for life. It is also 
His order for prayer. Prayer only fulfills the 
Master's ideal when it begins with the interests 
of God and follows with the needs of man. I am 
afraid that order rebukes very much of our pray- 
ing. Are we not all more or less in danger of 
praying first for all our own needs, and then in a 
closing sentence or two for the coming of the 
Kingdom of God? Christ in the form of this 
prayer teaches us that our first business in prayer 
is to seek with God for His victory in the world; 
that the deepest purpose of pra3^er is not that we 
may obtain what we need, but that God should 
gain that which glorifies His name. Passion for 
the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the 
world is the deepest note in prayer. 

Now let us take the first part of the prayer and 
look at it a little more closely. We find that the 
word ''heaven " occurs both in the invocation and 
in the qualifying phrase. Its recurrence arrests 
our attention, and at once we are conscious of a 
light and glory irradiating these first petitions. 
We pause therefore to inquire what this word is 
and what it suggests. We shall find that it is 
used in the New Testament with reference to 
three distinct spheres, or places, or regions, which- 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 71 

ever word may define most accurately the inde- 
finable spaces beyond our earth. It is used first 
of the atmosphere. "Behold the birds of the 
heaven." It is also used of the stellar spaces 
stretching far beyond the atmosphere. " I will 
show wonders in the heavens." It is used of still 
another region, of the dwelling place of other 
beings, of the place where the glory of the in- 
finite God is supremely manifest. "I knew a 
man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the 
body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I 
know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up 
even to the third heaven." We cannot place 
these ideas in relation to space because we know 
so little concerning it. There is a sense in which 
the third heaven enwraps and permeates the sec- 
ond and the first. All I want now to make clear 
is that the word " heaven " is used with a three- 
fold significance, and while poets and dreamers 
speak of a " seventh heaven," the Bible speaks 
only of a third. The word " heaven " therefore 
stands for the atmosphere, the stellar spaces, and 
finally the dwelling place of saints and angels. 

Yet another note upon this word. It is written 
sometimes in the singular and sometimes in the 
plural and our translations do not show the dif- 
ference uniformly. When in the singular it refers 
to one or other of these heavens; when in the 
plural it may refer to two or even three. The 
context or evident sense of the passage must de- 
cide which of three. " The day of the Lord will 
come as a thief; in the which the heavens shall

pass away with a great noise." The reference 
here is evidently to the atmospheric and the stellar 
spaces, the two first heavens. Stephen when dy- 
ing exclaimed, " Behold, I see the heavens opened, 
and the Son of Man standing on the right hand 
of God." He saw beyond the atmosphere, and 
beyond the stellar spaces into that place where 
God's glory is supremely manifest and the spirits 
of just men are. 

In the invocation the word " heaven " is plural. 
In the qualifying phrase at the close of the first 
three petitions it is singular. " Our Father which 
art in the heavens." Which of them? All of 
them. Thus there is found at the portal of the 
prayer the doctrine of the transcendence and im- 
manence of God. Your thought cannot carry you 
so far away as to escape Him; and yet where you 
are at this moment, " Closer is He than breathing, 
and nearer than hands and feet." Let us try to 
realize this by the simplest of simple diagrams. 

Saints and Seraphim 

Taking that dot as center I sweep a segment of 
a circle round it to represent the atmosphere 

THE PLANE OF PEAYER 73 

which extends for forty miles outward from tho 
earth. That is the first heaven of the New Testa- 
ment. Beyond that I sweep a larger segment 
representing the vast stellar spaces. That is the 
second heaven. Beyond that again is the third 
heaven. In the first circle I write the word " spar- 
rows "; in the next " stars," and in the next " saints 
and seraphim." We are here on this little earth, 
and having seen the revelation of the Father and 
yielded to the mediation of the Son, and answered 
the inspiration of the Spirit we are prepared for 
prayer. Jesus now says to us, " After this man- 
ner therefore pray ye; Our Father which art in 
the heavens." That is to say that the God who 
hears prayer is in all the heavens. That great and 
gracious fact is proven by other words of the Di- 
vine oracles. He is in the first heaven, the at- 
mosphere; " Are not two sparrows sold for a 
farthing? and not one of them shall fall on the 
ground without your Father." Let us most ear- 
nestly guard against spoiling the thought in that 
quotation by adding to it a single word. It is 
constantly rendered, " not one of them shall fall 
on the ground without your Father's hnowledgeP 
Jesus did not say that. It would have been a 
beautiful thing to say, but what He said was finer 
far, " not one of them shall fall on the ground 
without your Father." He not only watches from 
afar the sparrow's fall, but He holds it dying. 
The frailest bird dying of summer heat or winter 
cold is not alone. It dies in the company of God. 
And what of the stars of the second heaven? 

74 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

" By the greatness of His might, and for that He 
is strong in power, not one is lacking." *' Up- 
holding all things by the word of His power." 
And what of the saints and seraphim? They veil 
their faces in the presence of His glory, and do 
His will in the consciousness of His nearness. 

Thus as I begin to pray according to the pattern 
which the Lord gives me, I find at the portal of 
my prayer a doctrine of God which assures me 
that nothing is beyond His reach, and nothing is 
too small for His presence and attention. Oh, 
the infinite comfort of it 1 Mother, praying for 
your boy at the other side of the world, think of 
it I Your Father is with him there. He is as near 
to him as He is to you. Jesus did not say. Our 
Father who is away off in some distant heaven far 
removed from us; but rather, Our Father who art 
in all the heavens; close at hand so that the least 
whisper reaches Him, far away so that nothing 
can escape Him. 

Coming to the phrase with which these petitions 
end we find that the word " heaven " is singular. 
Now, while I do not mean to suggest that God's 
will is not done in the atmosphere or in the stellar 
spaces, I think it is evident that Christ's use of the 
singular at this point indicates the fact that His 
special reference was to that heaven where God's 
glorious presence is supremely manifest, and where 
the one abiding law is the law of His will. Thus 
when we pray this prayer we are asking that as 
His name is hallowed by the saints and seraphim, 
as His Kingdom is established among them, and 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 75 

as His will is the one and only law of all their ac- 
tivity, so on this earth His name may be hallowed, 
His Kingdom come, and His will be done. It is a 
prayer that the order of heaven may be established 
on earth. When Jesus uttered these words and 
gave them to His disciples as a pattern of prayer, 
He of course knew perfectly that order of the third 
heaven. Indeed His vision and perfect knowledge 
of that heavenly order were the inspiration of His 
desire as He stood among the sin and sorrow of 
this world. As we interpret the prayer through 
the One who gave it to us, it becomes an inspira- 
tion making us desire to know the order of the 
third heaven. Can we know anything of that 
order other than speculatively? If there is one 
thing concerning which no man ever ought to 
speculate, it is heaven. We have suffered terribly 
in our ideas of heaven from grotesque imagination 
concerning it. I remember as boy that heaven 
was to me a place where the saints sat on thrones 
forever and ever wearing white robes and having 
harps in their hands. It was suggestive of deadly 
monotony and far from attractive. Such is not 
the meaning of heaven. Jesus did not want us to 
pray that an order of that kind should be set up 
on earth. He was Himself a revelation to man 
of the heavenly order. Of the four evangelists 
John is the one who interprets to us most perfectly 
Christ as the Word of God out of heaven. The 
word " heaven " in John's Gospel is never plural, 
and it always has reference to the third heaven. 
The key words of John's writings are love, light, 

76 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

life. " God is love," " God is light," " God is life." 
These are three of the simplest words, and yet in 
all human speech there are none sublimer. These 
words perfectly portray the order obtaining in the 
heaven of God. Grant me these three words with 
all they suggest, and I care nothing about robes 
and harps and thrones. There may be all these 
things and will be, only do not let us forget that 
all that we know of earth's beauties and splen- 
dours are not worthy to be compared with the 
grace and glory yet to be revealed. 

In the third heaven love is the satisfactory im- 
pulse of everything. Light is the perfect intelli- 
gence in which all the inhabitants act. Life is 
the sufficient power by which they walk in light 
answering love. Love is impulse. Light is intel- 
ligence. Life is energy. The contrast between 
the order of the third heaven and that obtaining 
on earth today is at once manifest. No one is 
prepared to affirm that love is the final reason of 
all the activity of the world today. Christ says. 
Pray that it may become so. Men do not walk 
in perfect light even when it flashes upon their 
pathway, for, as in the days of Christ so still, 
men love darkness rather than light, for their 
works are evil. Christ says, " Pray that men 
may come to love light, and walk in it." And 
yet men have not life sufficient to do the highest 
and the best even when they know it. Toiler for 
God, in your specific service you know what it is 
to be weary. Do you know what weariness is? 
It is the touch of death. Press your toil a little 

THE PLANE OF PEAYER 77 

further, a little too far, and all the weary wheels 
stand still, and your eye sees no light, and your 
heart can no longer love. That is the condition 
of man in the world today. In God's third 
heaven everything is different. Love is the rea- 
son of devotion and worship. Love is the inspi- 
ration of giving and receiving. Love is the im- 
pulse of revelation and explanation. Every move- 
ment of the wing of the cherubim and every 
note of the song of the seraphim are alike love- 
impulsed. In heaven when love impulses light 
falls upon the pathway, and mistakes are never 
made through ignorance. There as in answer to 
love the inhabitants serve in perfect light; they 
are never weary for theirs is endless life. Jesus 
said, Pray that all this may be so also on this 
earth. Think what it would mean, what it will 
mean for the world when that prayer is answered, 
when "love " is the only reason, and "light " is 
perfect intelligence, and " life " is sufficient power 
for all accomplishment. 

Can that prayer be answered? Will it be an- 
swered? The first reply to such a question is 
that Jesus never taught men to utter vain prayers. 
The fact that He gave us this prayer is enough 
to make us offer it in the midst of the world's sin 
and sorrow and sighing, knowing that because He 
taught us so to pray the answer is bound to come. 
And yet there is another and profounder argu- 
ment for the reasonableness of this prayer, and 
that is Christ Himself. Once \n the history of 
the world that for which the prayer asks has been 

78 THE PEACTIOE OF PEAYEE 

perfectly realized. Once the world saw, though 
it did not understand it, the heavenly order. It 
was manifest when He, who taught us to pray, 
tabernacled amongst men. Studying the life of 
Jesus as we have it in the fourfold Gospel, it is 
perfectly evident that wherever and whenever we 
find Him the one reason of His being, or doing, 
or saying anything is love. He was perfectly 
and wholly impulsed by love. This is true not 
only of His words and acts most evidently ten- 
der, but also of the severe things He said and 
did. Some of these were terrible indeed, scorch- 
ing and startling men. On one occasion He 
looked into the faces of the rulers of His people 
and said, " Woe unto you. Scribes and Pharisees, 
hypocrites"; and it is impossible to read these 
words without being conscious that there was a 
note of terror in the voice of Jesus when He 
cried "Woe." Was that love? Yes, let Him 
finish His sentence, "for ye devour widows' 
houses." Love for the oppressed creates anger 
with the oppressor for evermore. Is there any 
phrase more startling than " the wrath of the 
Lamb'''' f I think that if we had desired to de- 
scribe wrath figuratively we should have written, 
the wrath of the " lion," but therein we should 
have failed. It is the wrath of the Lamb which 
is terrible, the wrath of One whose very heart 
and nature are love and gentleness. Wrath kin- 
dled by love is the fiercest fiame that burns. 

It is also true that in all the life of Jesus there 
was manifest the light of a perfectly informed 

THE PLANE OF PEAYER 79 

intelligence. He never hesitated. He was never 
perplexed. He never took counsel even with His 
own disciples. He consulted neither Conventions, 
Conferences, nor Committees. Ah, some one ac- 
quainted with the JS'ew Testament challenges that 
statement, and suggests that at least upon one 
occasion He called His disciples into Consultation. 
There was a day on which He asked one of them 
what was to be done to feed the multitude: but 
continue the story and you will read " This He 
said to prove him: for He Himself knew what 
He would do." Thus on the only occasion when 
it is ever suggested that He took counsel with His 
disciples the evangelist is careful to tell us that it 
was not that He might get advice, but in order 
that He might teach them something. He ever 
passed straight onward, and that perpetually on 
an illuminated pathway. Answering love He 
saw His way before Him and without hesitation 
walked in it. 

But, it will be said it was not true of Him that 
He had endless life â€” He died. Let me say first 
in answer to such an objection, that the life of 
Jesus was always sufficient for the doing of the 
will of God, and even though He knew in sym- 
pathy with us the heavy weariness which follows 
toil, He was never weary while God-appointed 
service waited for Him. And yet again, He had 
the power of endless life as witness His own 
strange words, " I lay down My life, that I may 
take it again. Ko one taketh it away from Me, 
but I lay it down of Myself. 1 have power to lay 

80 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

it down, and I have power to take it again. This 
commandment received I from My Father." 
Death in the case of every other man is a fact 
from which He cannot escape. Death in the case 
of Jesus was an act in the mystery of which He 
was yet the supreme Lord and Master. He died 
and rose again in fulfillment of these wonderful 
words. Once in human history the heavenly 
order has been seen in a Man who answered love 
and walked in light, and had such life as enabled 
Him to die and to live again, and so doing to fling 
up a highway out of death for all such as trust 
and follow Him. 

But what did the world do with this Revealer? 
The story is that of the world's final tragedy. 
Hatred murdered love. Darkness put out light. 
Death conquered life. 

The Cross was man's answer to this prayer. 
But again, the Cross was God's answer to this 
prayer. Put both things together, or let us hear 
them put together by Peter in the first message 
delivered after Pentecost. " Him, being delivered 
up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge 
of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify 
and slay." Man's attitude towards the revelation 
of the heavenly order â€” " ye by the hand of law- 
less men did crucify and slay," God's activity in 
the midst of the mystery of death â€” " delivered up 
by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of 
God." Over against the lawlessness of man's 
murder the deliberate counsel of God is operative, 
and thus the very Cross which marks man's re- 

THE PLAKE OF PEAYEE 81 

fusal of the Kingdom becomes the means by 
which that Kingdom is yet to be set up. 

When thus we observe the Man who taught us 
this prayer and come to understand that He em- 
bodied in His own life the principles He bids us 
seek, and when we know that by His Cross He 
made it possible for every man to come after Him, 
to answer " love," and to walk in " light " in the 
power of " life," then we pray the first part of 
this prayer as never before, realizing that in the 
name and merit and might of Him who taught 
us so to pray its final answer must come. 

Thus the pattern prayer teaches us first that 
we must take the whole world into our praying, 
and that we must see clearly that the line of its 
redemption is that of return to conformity to the 
will of God, made possible by the life and death 
and resurrection of Him who taught us to pray â€” 

Our Father which art in the heavens, 
Thy name be hallowed, 
Thy Kingdom come, 
Thy will be done, 

as in heaven so on earth. 
Give us this day our daily bread. 

And 
Forgive us our debts, as we also 
have forgiven our debtors. 
And 
Lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil.

YI 

THE PLANE OF PRAYER 
(b) The Pilgrimage of Man 

We now coine to the second part of the pattern 
prayer. As the first part has to do with the in- 
terests of God, the second half deals with the pil- 
grimage of man; that is to say, it has to do with 
the needs of man in the days of his sojourn in this 
world. Its three petitions express the needs of 
these days of pilgrimage towards the Father's 
home. It will be impossible to use these petitions 
when we reach that home. They express our 
present need in the listening ear of God. 

If these petitions be intelligently apprehended, 
it will be found that they cover the whole of our 
possible requirements. We may break up the 
petitions, we may give expression in the hours of 
communion with God to the detailed and specific 
need of which we are conscious, but we cannot 
pray for anything which is not included in these 
requests. 

In previous chapters we have dealt with the 
threefold fact concerning God which Jesus has re- 
vealed. He is King, Father, Shepherd. In that 
order men come into relationship with Him. 
Having submitted to His Kingship, they find Him 
to be their Father. Then as they begin to walk 

85 

86 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

along the pathway which His will appoints, they 
experience His care as a Shepherd. 

The part of the prayer at which we are now 
to look is the cry of children-subjects, asking for 
the privileges of the flock, for the care of the 
one great Shepherd. In it there are three peti- 
tions â€” 

Give us this day our daily bread. 

And 
Forgive us our debts, as we also 

have forgiven our debtors. 
' And 

Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us 
from evil, or, from the evil one. 

As we study these three petitions we shall find 
that in each of them three sets of forces with 
which we daily come in contact are recognized. 
Every man upon the pathway of his pilgrimage 
has to do every day with God, with man and 
with the devil. That fact may be expressed in 
other words. We may say that we have to do 
with the upper world, with the world about us, 
and with the under world of evil. Every day 
we who are children of God have necessarily 
some dealings with God; every day we are in 
contact with our fellow man; and I do not think 
any one will dispute with me when I declare 
that for the saint of God there is no day in 
which he or she has not something to do with 
the spirits of evil. The three worlds are present 
in every one of these petitions, but in each peti- 
tion one realm is referred to with special em- 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 87 

phasis. To take the first, " Give us this day our 
dailj bread." That petition has to do pre- 
eminently with our relationship to God, our de- 
pendence upon Him; but we shall find recog- 
nized in it our relationship to our fellow man, 
and also our relationship to the spirits of evil. 
The preeminent note is our relationship to God. 
In the second petition, " Forgive us our debts as 
we also have forgiven our debtors," the principal 
emphasis is upon our relationship to our fellow 
men. The relationship to God is acknowledged 
and the relationship to the under world is evi- 
dent. In the final petition, " Lead us not into 
temptation, but deliver us from evil," the principal 
emphasis is upon our relationship to the under 
world. Our relationship to God is also recog- 
nized and that to our fellow man is present. 

When referring to the threefold fact of the 
heavenly order proceeding from the government 
of God we mentioned three words which are 
constantly repeated in the writings of John, 
" Life," " Light," and " Love." The first of these 
three petitions is a cry for sustenance to God as 
" Life." The second is a cry for rectitude to God 
as " Light." The last is a cry for victory to God 
as " Love." So that the threefold order, which 
we first are taught to pray may be established in 
the world, is recognized when we continue to 
pray about our own persoidal and individual 
needs. 

In the economy of Jesus Christ, prayer never 
loses sight of the infinite relationships and the 

88 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

infinite values. Herein is the test for our pray- 
ing. The moment prayer becomes request for 
something purely for self which may be spent 
upon personal lusts â€” or if you will have a milder 
word, upon personal desires â€” then prayer is out- 
side the will of God. If I ask for sustenance it 
must be in a petition which recognizes that real 
life is related to the life of God. If I ask for 
rectitude it must be in a petition which recog- 
nizes rectitude as being in right relationship with 
the light of God. If I ask for succor, deliver- 
ance from the evil of the under world, it must be 
in a petition which recognizes the tender love of 
God manifesting itself supremely in its persistent 
determination that I shall be delivered from evil. 
So that all prayer is to be tested by its relation- 
ship to the infinite and eternal verities and values. 
Let us now take the petitions one by one. In 
the first, " Give us this day our daily bread," we 
have the threefold relationship. First, it is a cry 
to God as " Life " for sustenance. There is also 
recognized the relationship to man. We cannot 
begin to pray this prayer alone; we immediately 
bring othei's w'lh us into the place of prayer not 
as to bodily presence but as to social interest. 
That fact is true of the whole prayer, but specially 
true of the first petition. We have also the ref- 
erence to the under world, because life fed with 
daily bread is made strong against the solicita- 
tion of the spirits of evil. The principal em- 
phasis is, however, upon our relation to God. 
What then does this prayer mean, " Give us this 

THE PLANE OF PEAYER 89 

day our daily bread "? What is daily bread? 
What did our Lord mean we were to pray for at 
this point? Let us omit the word " daily " for 
the moment, and read " Give us this day our 
bread." Of what bread was He speaking? 
There are those who hold that this prayer simply 
has reference to the bread of the physical life, 
and there are thousands of people who use it only 
in that sense. There are other people, some of 
them gifted expositors of the Word of God, who 
hold that our Lord was not referring in any way 
to the physical bread but that this is wholly a 
spiritual prayer, and that therefore He is here re- 
ferring to the sustenance of the spiritual life. I 
do not agree with either of these interpretations. 
I believe that when our Lord enjoins us to pray 
" Give us this day our bread " He means by the 
use of that word all that is necessary for the 
sustenance of the whole life, physical and 
spiritual. I believe that, because I never find 
Jesus dealing with men in compartments. He 
always dealt with the whole man, and when He 
taught us to pray this prayer He intended to 
teach us that we were perpetually to remember 
that we are absolutely dependent upon God for 
all that is necessary for the sustenance of our 
perfect and complete life. In Deuteronomy we 
read "Man doth not live by bread only, but by 
everything that proceedeth out of the mouth of 
the Lord." There, in these words He quoted in 
the midst of His own temptation, is His own 
recognition of the need of physical bread; and 

90 THE PEACTIOE OF PEAYEE 

therein is His affirmation of the necessity for 
another bread, the Word proceeding out of the 
mouth of God. He Himself being the Word of 
God said, " I am the bread of life." When this 
petition is presented we are asking God to give 
us the sustenance necessary for our whole life, 
that necessary for our spiritual, and that neces- 
sary for our physical life. The latter is secondary 
but it is necessary, and is as much supplied by 
God as is the sustenance for the spiritual life. 
The first petition of our need is one in which we 
ask our Father to supply all that is necessary for 
our complete sustenance " Give us this day our 
bread." 

I think that an understanding of the word 
" daily " will emphasize the accuracy of the in- 
terpretation I have given. There is difficulty 
here. As a matter of fact it is a word quite un- 
known in classical Greek, and it is a word which 
never occurs in the New Testament except at this 
point in Matthew 6 and in Luke 11 where our 
Lord took one or two petitions of the prayer and 
gave them to His disciples in answer to their re- 
quest. It would be a fascinating theme for dis- 
cussion and speculation as to where this word 
came from and what it really means. There are 
difficulties in tracing its root. You notice in the 
margin of the Revised Version this suggestion, 
^^ Give us this day our bread * for the coming 
day.'" If you have noticed it, you have felt 
how curious a suggestion it is. I want to speak 
with all due carefulness, and I do not speak with- 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 91 

out remembering that the marginal readings of 
the Kevised Version express the opinion of a ma- 
jority of the translators. Nevertheless, I do not 
think that the meaning of this word translated 
" daily " is " the coming day." It is possible that 
it came from a root which means " tomorrow "; 
but it is equally possible that it came from a root 
implying " existence," It is not for me to go into 
that particularly, but I do not hesitate to say my 
own belief is that the latter is the root from 
which this word " daily " came. " Give us this 
day our bread of existence." Here is a piece of 
speculation which you may accept or forget as 
you like. I believe Jesus coined that word. You 
cannot find it anywhere else. Then of course 
there comes the question as to whether Jesus 
spoke in Aramaic or Greek, and again we are face 
to face with a question full of interest, and one 
which I do not pretend to be able dogmatically 
or finally to decide. Personally, I am of opinion 
that the Gospel of Matthew was written in Greek, 
and moreover that Jesus spoke a dialect of Greek 
which was common at the time. It is interesting 
to remember that Alford in his later editions 
adopted that view, although in the earlier issues 
of his work he had maintained the contrary. I 
believe therefore that Jesus coined this word 
" daily." What He told us to pray was, " Give 
us today the bread we need for our existence "; 
that is, for our whole life, for the life which is 
physical, for the life which is spiritual. 

Passing from that discussion of the mere words 

92 THE PEACTICE OP PEAYEE 

of the petition, let us think of its spiritual inten- 
tion and meaning. We are to ask God every day 
for what we need for the sustenance of our life. 
There are two ways in which we neglect this pe- 
tition. One way is that we pray it as though it 
simply referred to the bread which feeds the body, 
and forget that we need day by day to be fed by 
God with the bread which supplies our spiritual 
life. As God answers prayer for the bread of 
the body so He answers prayer for the bread of 
the spirit. How does God answer our prayer for 
the bread of the body? Not by its miraculous 
supply but by the gift of all such forces as are 
( necessary to enable us in cooperation with Him- 
i self to obtain for ourselves by labor the bread 
: we need. So with the spiritual bread. God does 
' not succor the spiritual life of any man on his 
simple asking. Our spiritual life can only be 
maintained and sustained as we in personal la- 
bour for the meat that endureth, meditate in His 
Word day and night, feeding upon that Bread of 
Life which came down out of heaven from God. 
The other side of the lesson is that we are not 
to forget in these days of incipient infidelity in 
the Christian Church, that the table to which we 
sit down every day is one He spreads. You have 
heard the old story of the man who met a boy 
in a village street carrying a loaf of bread. He 
stopped the boy and asked him where he got the 
loaf. '* From the baker " was the reply. " Yes, 
that is right, but where did he get it? " " He 
made it," said the boy. " How did he make it? " 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 93 

" With flour." " Where did he get his flour? " 
" He ground the corn." " Where did he get his 
corn from? " " He got it from the farmer." 
" Yes, but where did the farmer get his corn? " 
" Oh, from God," said the boy. " Then you got 
your loaf from God! " We have been very much 
like that boy. We have put God away back, be- 
hind the miller and the farmer, and have forgot- 
ten Him in the process. While we recognize the 
need of the intermediation of all these instru- 
ments, we are not to forget that it is God who 
feeds us with food sufficient for body and soul. 

Back of the loaf is the snowy flour, 

And back of the flour the mill; 
And back of the mill is the wheat, and the shower, 

And the sun, and the Father's will. 

This prayer brings me back every day as a de- 
pendent being to God, so that I have never any 
right to pray this prayer if I am saying in my life 
or by my actions, my own hand gets me this bread, 
my own cunning, wit and wisdom provide for me 
all I need of spiritual culture. 

Notice the social character of this prayer. Have 
you ever taken the trouble to write out the per- 
sonal pronouns in the first person? If you have, 
you will have discovered that there is not one in 
the singular from beginning to end, â€” our, us, our, 
us, our, we, our, us, us. They are all plural. 
You cannot pray that prayer by yourself. You 
cannot pray that short petition by yourself. I 
remember a friend of mine, a deacon in one of 

94 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

my former churches, on a certain Harvest Festival, 
came to me in my vestry and said â€” there was a 
deal of humor in him, there always is in saintly 
men, â€” " Well, Pastor, I suppose you won't use the 
Lord's Prayer tonight. We are going to thank 
Him for having supplied our daily bread, you 
won't ask Him for it? " I replied that we should 
certainly use the Lord's Prayer that night, and 
that by so doing we should put ourselves into fel- 
lowship with all hungry souls. It is " us " and 
" our," not " me " and " mine." When we come 
into God's presence to ask for the supply of our 
own need we are to remember in loving sympa- 
thy the need of all those who have not yet re- 
ceived. 

There is another suggestive fact about this 
prayer. There is only one nominative case in it. 
There are four objective and four possessive, but 
only one nominative. Do you not know that the 
nominative is the most popular case. Men like 
to talk in the first person singular, nominative; 
but the nominative is only here once. " Forgive 
us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debt- 
ors." The only right in this prayer to be the 
subject of a sentence is that of the loving heart 
who forgives some other man. The prayer is a 
social prayer from beginning to end. The social 
quality is manifest in this first petition as it asks 
for sustenance not for " me and mine," but for 
" us and ours." 

The relation to the under world is also recog- 
nized here. The man fed, physically and spirit- 

THE PLANE OF PEAYER 95 

ually, is the man most likely to be strong against 
the solicitations of evil. That is why men are 
perfectly right when they tell us that we insult a 
hungry man when we offer him a tract about 
heaven. The first thing is to feed him, not simply 
because he clamors for bread, but because a fed 
man is one the devil does not like. It is the 
hungry man the devil attacks. If that be true 
physically, it is preeminently true spiritually. 
My brother see to it that when morning breaks 
you go to God for sustenance for your spiritual 
life. That will make you strong against the 
allurements of the devil. So many people turn 
out to face the temptations of the day spiritually 
unfed, spiritually hungry therefore, and they are 
attacked by all kinds of enticements of the 
enemy. It is the man fed by God, spiritually 
and physically who is likely to overcome in the 
hour of temptation. 

In the second petition will you notice that the 
relation to God comes first. It always does even 
if the emphasis is not there. We are to ask for- 
givenessâ€”this is the one petition to which most 
people object, and some attempt to escape from 
the prayer because of it. I am not particularly 
surprised that people criticize this petition more 
than any other. It is a very difficult one to pray, 
but let us remember that when Christ gave this 
prayer in His Manifesto, He commented only 
upon this petition. " For if ye forgive not men 
their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive 
your trespasses." So we must neither get away 

96 THE PEAOTICE OF PRAYEK 

from this petition, nor indulge in that criticism 
which attempts to accommodate it to our own 
failure. I had been speaking on this subject in 
an American city, and afterwards received a letter 
from a lady who was greatly perturbed because I 
had put special emphasis upon the fact that Jesus 
distinctly tells us we are to ask for forgiveness 
when we have forgiven. She said that for years 
she had changed the form of that petition for she 
had been afraid of it, and had said, " Forgive us 
our debts, and we will forgive our debtors." She 
asked if I did not consider this to be sufficient. I 
replied that God never does business on the basis 
of a promissory note. We must get our forgiv- 
ing done before we can ask for forgiveness. That 
prayer is the prayer of the children of God, not 
of the men outside. I do not go to the man out- 
side who has never given himself to God and tell 
him that if he will forgive everybody, God will 
forgive him. God begins by forgiving us of His 
own free grace without any condition. The un- 
forgiven man can be forgiven now, without any 
condition except that he believe on the Lord Jesus 
Christ. He will blot out the sins of such like a 
thick cloud. When that is done the soul enters 
the Kingdom, and now Jesus superimposes upon 
His own subject as the condition for forgiveness 
that he should be forgiving. If we are unforgiv- 
ing, in the necessity of the case God will not for- 
give us. There is no escape from it. Is not hatred 
the most dastardly and heinous of all sins- 
hatred, the thing that contradicts the essence of 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 97 

God which is love? If in my heart there is bit- 
terness and malice and revengefulness what is the 
use of confessing other sins and expecting to be for- 
given, nursing the while the most damnable sin? 
We who are children of God, subjects of the King, 
flock of the Shepherd, cannot be forgiven unless 
we forgive, for our refusal to forgive is the deepest 
and worst sin of all. I speak with such emphasis 
because I think the Church of Jesus Christ is 
cursed by an unforgiving spirit. Men and women 
are sitting down at the table of the Lord who do 
not speak to each other. We are unforgiving in 
our theological controversies. The sin for which 
Moses was excluded from the earthly promised 
land was that " He spake unadvisedly with his 
lips," he manifested a provoked spirit in a right- 
eous cause. A righteous cause, but an angry, un- 
forgiving man; and God shut him out of the 
land of earthly promise. For evermore Jesus 
Christ is saying to us every day, " Come and have 
your Father's forgiveness for trespasses, but do 
not ask for that until you have forgiven the man 
who has trespassed against you." What is tres- 
pass? For notice, in the actual text our Lord 
used the words " Debt " and " debtors " and in 
the exposition which follows. He used the word 
"trespasses." What then is debt, trespass? 
There is a common quality in our Master's use of 
the two words which helps us to understand it. 
Trespass is intentional error, or willful transgres- 
sion. Trench has said the word means falling 
where one should have stood upright, whether 

98 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

one could help it or not. There of course arises 
the whole question of sin and of what sin is. We 
still believe that the whole meaning of the 'New 
Testament evangel is that a man need not sin 
willfully, but we still maintain that so long as we 
walk the pathway of the earthly pilgrimage, in 
comparison with God's high ideal we are as tres- 
passers, coming short, so that of our best service 
we have to say " we are unprofitable servants." 

I pity the man who tells me he cannot pray 
this prayer because he never trespasses. I pity 
him because of his dim comprehension of the real 
meaning of holiness and of sin. To the man who 
walks in light there is no day when he does not 
find it necessary to confess his trespasses. Let 
us not forget this flaming scorching word of the 
Master, that we are not to ask for forgiveness 
until we have forgiven. " If therefore thou art 
offering thy gift at the altar, and there remem- 
berest that thy brother hath aught against thee, 
leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy 
way, first be reconciled to thy brother and then 
come and offer thy gift." I wonder how many 
people would have to stay away from church next 
Sunday if they were true to this word. We had 
better stay away, and get right with our brother 
before we come to the altar. " If ye forgive not 
men their trespasses, neither will your Father 
forgive your trespasses." Loving forgiveness of 
my brother is the condition upon which I, a child 
of God, may ask His forgiveness. 

What relation has all this to the underworld 

THE PLANE OF PEAYEE 99 

of evil? When we forgive those who have 
wronged us, we have gained the mightiest victory 
possible over the devil. In that day when we 
trampled on our pride and sacrificed what we 
speak of as our rights, when we triumphed over 
pride and lovingly forgave the man who had 
sinned against us, we know we were conscious of 
God as we had never been before, and we were 
conscious of victory over the enemy as we had 
never been. There is nothing God loves and the 
devil hates more than a man who can forgive. 

We come to the last of these petitions. " And 
bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from 
the evil one." " Bring us not into temptation," 
that is the language of the cautious heart, of the 
man who recognizes how terrible an experience 
temptation is. Bat there is something more im- 
portant than that I should be delivered from 
temptation, and that is that I should be delivered 
from evil. If I can only be delivered from evil 
by passing through temptation, then that I be 
delivered from evil is the supreme matter. In 
that remarkable passage in Luke just before the 
Gethsemane experience and again just after it, 
the Lord said to His disciples, '^ Pray that ye en- 
ter not into temptation." He was passing down 
to temptation then. As I watch Him in Geth- 
semane I hear the echo of temptation, " Father, 
if Thou be willing, remove this cup from Me; 
nevertheless not My will, but Thine be done." 
That is the echo of temptation. I have heard 
that before. I heard the enemy say to Him long 

100 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

ago in the wilderness, " There are the Kingdoms 
of the world which you have come to possess. 
Your pathway to them is one of suffering and 
shame. Fall down and worship me and I will 
give them to you. Get to your goal by a short 
cut." Here is the old method. Be very afraid 
of any easy method to anything. I hear it again 
later on, not as before in the open attack of the 
foe, but through the subtle word of friendship. 
When Jesus at Caesarea Philippi mentioned the 
cross, Peter said, " Not that. Lord I That be far 
from Thee. Keys, yes; crowning, yes; build- 
ing, yes; but not the cross! " Christ said to him, 
" Get thee behind Me, Satan: thou art a stumbling- 
block unto Me; for thou mindest not the things 
of God, but the things of men." In the garden 
of Gethsemane the devil comes no longer in open 
attack, no longer in the guise of a friend, but in 
the shrinking of His own soul. "If Thou be 
willing, remove this cup from Me." Therein is 
the philosophy of this petition, " Bring us not 
into temptation." We are to be afraid of temp- 
tation. We are not to be foolhardy, treating it 
as of no account. We are to shrink in its pres- 
ence with that cautiousness which makes for 
courage. But the more important thing is that 
we should be delivered perfectly from evil. 
"Bring us not into temptation, but deliver us 
from evil." That is to be my prayer every day 
to God who governs in hell as well as in heaven. 
Kecognition of the force of temptation and its 
subtlety will make me pray, " Bring me not into 

THE PLAITE OF PEAYEE 101 

temptation," but the deepest passion of my whole 
life will be â€” " deliver me from evil." 

What relation to other men is suggested in 
this last petition? Peter writing to Christian 
people said, "Be sober, be watchful: your ad- 
versary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh 
about, seeking whom he may devour." Why 
were they to be sober and watchful? " Know- 
ing that the same sufferings are accomplished in 
your brethren who are in the world." Let the 
light of that fall upon this petition. When we 
are face to face with the evil one and with temp- 
tation, we are not fighting a lonely battle, we are 
part of a great host. Our brethren are being 
tried also. If we win, they win in a greater meas- 
ure. If we lose, we shall halt the whole battle 
and retard the final victory. I sometimes think 
if we could say this to young people as it ought 
to be said we might help them. Are you fight- 
ing against temptation? Kemember it is not a 
lonely battle you are fighting, you are part of a 
great host. If you lose, if you are beaten, if the 
enemy overcomes you, the whole army of God is 
halted in its onward march. If you win, you 
hasten the coming of the Kingdom. The same 
sufferings are being accomplished in your breth- 
ren. Upon this stress and strife of the saints de- 
pends the hastening or retarding of the Day of 
God. So we are to pray together " Bring us not 
into temptation, but deliver us from evil." We 
fear the process, but there is a deeper passion than 
the passion for escape from testing, it is the pas- 

102 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

sion for deliverance from evil. That is the great 
and final thing. 

In conclusion, let it be noted that He who 
taught the prayer has in its second half, as in the 
first, guaranteed the answer. Am I to pray for 
the bread of life? He bends over me and says, 
" I am the Bread of Life." Am I to pray for 
sustenance of the physical life? He whispers to 
me, hear the tender promise, " All these things 
shall be added unto you." Am I to pray for for- 
giveness? Through His name is forgiveness 
preached. But how am I going to forgive the 
man who has injured me? The Spirit of Jesus 
is the spirit of forgiveness. If I am yielded to 
Him He is yielded to me. If I give my whole 
life to Him He will give His Avhole life to me. 
If I have Jesus for my own I shall be able to for- 
give, so that He will answer this very prayer and 
make possible its answer in the high court of 
God's own judgment hall. As to temptation, 
" He was tempted in all points like as we are, sin 
apart." And " In that He Himself hath suffered 
being tempted. He is able to succor them that 
are tempted." 

So in this pattern prayer He shows me what to 
pray for as He opens before my astonished vision 
the whole realm of prayer. I end as I begin by 
saying that if we can pray this prayer with spir- 
itual intelligence and earnestness we pray all 
prayer. 

THE PRACTICE OF PRAYER 

" And when ye pray, ye shall not be as the hypocrites: for they 
love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the 
streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They 
have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thine 
inner chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father which 
is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall recompense 
thee. And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; 
for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. 
Be not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what 
things ye have need of, before ye ask Him.'''' â€” Matthew 6: 5-8. 

' ' Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as 
touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of 
My Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered 
together in My name, there am Jin the midst ofthem.^' â€” MATTHEW 
18: 19, 20. 

YII 

THE PRACTICE OF PRAYER 

The subjects already considered are all pre- 
liniinary to and necessary for the present one. 
God has made prayer possible to us through 
Jesus. We can pray prevailingly only as we re- 
spond to the truths which create the possibility. 
The sphere of prayer includes the coming of the 
Kingdom of God and the provision of all the need 
of the saints. Thus all these constitute an inte- 
gral part of the subject of the practice of prayer. 
Prayer is only possible to the revealed Father 
through the mediating Son by the inspiring 
Spirit. Prayer is only a prevailing power as, in 
the life, the child of God is loyal to His King- 
ship, satisfied with His provision, conformed to 
His likeness. Moreover, it can only be operative 
within the sphere revealed in the pattern prayer. 

All this being granted, we now come to the 
more technical consideration of this subject. It 
is necessary both in order to brevity and clear- 
ness that we should follow a process of elimina- 
tion. The teaching of Jesus is so full of instruc- 
tion concerning prayer that we do not propose to 
attempt even a survey of the whole field, but to 
confine ourselves to the words dealing with the 
two main lines of responsibility in this matter, 
105 

106 THE PEAOTICE OF PEAYER 

those namely, of the practice of prayer person- 
ally, and the practice of prayer collectively. 

First, as to the former. " But thou, when thou 
pray est, enter into thine inner chamber, and hav- 
ing shut thy door, pray to thy Father v^hich is in 
secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall 
recompense thee." We are at once arrested by 
the " but " with which the passage opens. It 
makes us conscious of a background, of a contrast 
which flung the actual words into clearer relief. 
Immediately preceding Jesus had said, " Ye shall 
not be as the hypocrites; for they love to stand 
and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of 
the streets, that they may be seen of men." JSToW 
it is perfectly evident that our Lord did not mean 
to say it was wrong to stand and pray in the syna- 
gogue or at the corner of the street. That against 
which He warned His disciples was the praying 
which had as its deepest desire a wish to be seen 
of men. He charged them to beware of the prayer 
which obtrudes itself upon human notice. Mark 
His gentle satire in this respect, " Verily I say 
unto you, they have their reward." That is to 
say, they pray to be seen of men, they are seen 
of men. What they desire, they obtain. This is 
the background. We are interested in the in- 
structions to which these warnings gave rise. 
"When thou pray est, enter into thine inner cham- 
ber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father 
which is in secret." Thus Christ instructed His 
disciples that in the life of each one of them there 
must be a special place, a special time and a special 

THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEK 107 

method, whereby in quietness and loneliness, 
every third person being excluded, each one 
should pray. 

Then as to the latter, " If two of you shall agree 
on earth as touching anything they shall ask, it 
shall be done for them of My Father which is in 
heaven. For where two or three are gathered 
together in My name, there am I in the midst of 
them." As the first passage insisted upon loneli- 
ness, this provides for fellowship in prayer. It 
declares the conditions of the true prayer-meeting. 
The promise is indeed a spacious one. " If two of 
you shall agree on earth as touching anything that 
they shall ask, it shall be done for them." It is a 
somewhat curious thing that this promise is so 
perpetually misquoted by the addition of the 
words, " concerning My Kingdom." It may be 
said that this, of course, was what our Lord meant 
us to understand. I unhesitatingly reply that we 
have no right to imagine that He meant anything 
other than He said. To introduce these words 
is to put a limit upon prayer which He did not 
put. If it be objected that this is a dangerous 
doctrine, I reply that Christ clearly marked the 
limits of such agreement and such asking in the 
words, " For where two or three are gathered to- 
gether in My name, there am I in the midst of 
them." The promise is not made to two or three 
persons who meet together, and ask simply upon 
the basis of their own desire. "Jesus in the midst" 
means Jesus enthroned, obeyed, consulted. Where 
He is enthroned, obeyed, consulted, the Spirit 

108 THE PEACTICE OP PRAYEE 

creates desire, and prayer being in harmony 
witti the will of God, the answer is assured. We 
must neither put false limitations upon this word 
of the Master, nor must we imagine that there 
are no limitations. According to Him, the limit 
is not upon the things for which we may ask, but 
upon our condition and the Spirit in which we ask. 
Two or three of us may agree as to our desire for 
certain things, and may ask for them, and never 
receive them. The prayer-meeting must not be 
based upon desire, but upon relationship to Christ. 

1 If two or three of us are gathered together in His 
/ name, under the dominion of His life, inspired by 
\ His Spirit, and if in the hearts of those thus gath- 

j ered there is created a common desire, then they 

\ may ask and be assured of the answer. 

* These then are the two words of Jesus about 
prayer which reveal the broad lines of its practice. 
Firstly that we enter into an inner chamber, shut 
the door, and pray alone; and secondly, that we 
gather together two or three in His name and pray. 
One man may pray alone, indeed he must do so 
shutting out every other person; but that does not 
exhaust the practice of prayer. There must be 
the prayer-meeting. It is not necessarily a large 
gathering. The Master names the smallest num- 
ber that can constitute a meeting â€” two. There 
cannot be a meeting of one. Yet the larger num- 
ber is not necessarily wrong. The indefiniteness 
of His phrase " two or three " includes the possi- 
bility of the larger gathering. That which creates 
the true prayer-meeting is the inspiration of saints 

THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 109 

in communion with each other, because baptized 
b}^ the Spirit into living communion with Christ. 
Now for the most practical of words concerning 
each of these methods. As to the first, I desire to 
insist upon the necessity for the formation of very 
definite habits. The words of the Master could 
not be more emphatic than they are as to the 
necessity for separation, seclusion, and secrecy. 
An inner chamber and a shut door certainly mean 
that there must be in the life of every man or 
woman or child a place for retirement, a time for 
seclusion, an exercise of this high and holy privi- 
lege in absolute loneliness, when husband or wife, 
father or mother, brother or sister, son or daugh- 
ter, is excluded. In all our busy life nothing is of 
more importance than that we should have some 
place peculiarly consecrated to prayer. The soul 
needs a Bethel. It may not be a place retained 
exclusively for prayer, but it should be a place to 
which at set times we may go and know that we 
shall be free from intrusion. For every minister 
of the Gospel this Bethel ought to be his study. 
I know how constantly we think of the study as 
the workroom, and rightly so. Woe be to the 
preacher of the Word who is not a workman. 
But the study ought to be at times the place 
where we may look into the face of God alone 
and hold personal communion with Him. This 
may sound like a plea for the private oratory of 
the Eoman Catholic, and so it is in all its deepest 
spiritual intention. For the material trappings 
of crucifix, picture, or candle I care nothing, but 

110 THE PKAOTICE OF PEAYER 

for the spiritual intention of lonely communion 
with God in some set place, I care increasingly. 
There is far more than seems in the place set 
apart. Those of us who preach the Word surely 
know what it is to feel the ease of preaching in 
the place with which one is perfectly familiar. 
Familiarity enables f orgetf ulness of surroundings. 
The " where " matters little. The fact that there 
is a place is of great importance. To object to the 
idea of locality is to imagine there was no mean- 
ing in the words of Jesus when He spoke of an 
" inner chamber " and a " shut door." To the 
merchant, it may be his private office, locked at a 
certain time for loneliness with God. To the 
mother it may be the quiet of her own room from 
w^hich for a little she is able to exclude all those 
who serve under her in the maintenance of home. 
It seems to me that if the watchers in the heav- 
enly places observe the places of the sons of men 
amid earth's conflict, those in which they are 
most interested are the secret places where the 
saints hold converse with God. Until we find 
some place of habitual loneliness made sacred, 
not by material accessories, but by spiritual ac- 
cess, we are not as strong as we might be, and we 
have not formed the mightiest habit in the life of 
prayer. Then it is of equal importance that there 
should be a special time for prayer. I am perfectly 
well aware of the answer that comes from thou- 
sands of toilers today. This is a busy age. Of 
that there can be no denial, but if the age is too 
busy to pray, so much the worse for the age; or 

THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 111 

rather if in the age we are too busy to pray, so 
much the worse for our business. As to the time 
of prayer there can be no little doubt that for 
those who are able the " morning watch " is the 
finest. Yet I would urge none to be slave of 
the habit of another. If a proper regard for 
physical conditions makes it necessary for some 
over- wrought daughter of the King to rest in the 
morning hour, let her remember that she is not 
under law, but under grace. Then let there be 
no escape from the importance of time by declar- 
ing the brevity of the day, and the multiplication 
of positive duties. In fellowship with God the 
terms long or short ought to be cancelled. ^ Five 
minutes with Him in which the soul is touched 
by the forces of eternity will mean a day full of 
spiritual vigor. God can do much in five minutes 
of man's time if no more can honestly be spared. 
He can do nothing in five minutes for the man 
who should give Him sixty, who but is slothful. 
Those who know the value of lonely fellowship 
with God, at the beginning of the day, know also; 
how hot and restless is the day from which that j 
time of communion has been absent. Again I say, ( 
cultivate that method of prayer which is most 
helpful, whether it be that of speaking aloud in 
loneliness, or of communing in stillness of heart 
and silence, whether standing or kneeling or sit- 
ting. No special attitude is insisted upon as 
necessary in the Word of God. The matter of 
supreme importance is that we discover the 
method of prayer which helps us most actually 

112 THE PEACTIOE OF PEATER 

to realize the presence of God and hold com- 
munion with Him. The place, the time, the 
method, are matters concerning which there must 
be individual choice and decision. The matter of 
supreme importance is the cultivation of the habit 
of prayer. I do not use the word habit carelessly. 
Habits need to be formed whether they are good 
or evil. With regard to prayer that which is at 
first perhaps somewhat trying and difficult, be- 
comes so much a part of the life as to be not 
second nature, but first nature. In all these mat- 
ters it is important to distinguish between the es- 
sentials and the accidentals. 

It would be disastrous if any should imagine 
that these set times exhausted the practice of 
personal prayer. Our Lord declared that " Men 
ought always to pray, and not to faint," and that 
is a very profound word. It is evident that His 
conception of life is that if men pray they will 
not faint, and conversely, if men do not pray 
then will they faint. This word indicates the 
fact that Jesus had a profound consciousness of 
the pressure and strain of life. He did not think 
it was a soothing softness through which men 
glide. To Him life was indeed simple, but also 
strenuous. He knew that men would be in dan- 
ger of fainting underneath the burden and in the 
midst of the battle. He knew also a power 
which would prevent their fainting. " Men 
ought always to pray, and not to faint." No 
man will pray always who neglects the forma- 
tion of the habit of regular prayer. The dis- 

THE PEAOTICE OF PEAYEE 113 

ciple who regularly observes a place and time 
and method will gradually find the habit learned 
in the secret place is binding also through all the 
public life. A confirmed habit of regular prayer 
will create regularity and constancy amidst all 
irregularities of time and place and method. 
Prayer in the secret place will create a spirit ^ 
which will obtain in all public places. Grad- 
ually thoughts will become prayers, thoughts of 
absent friends will take wings and move up- 
wards. Fellowship with God as an activity will; 
issue in "fellowship with God as an attitude. 
When this~isrsb, anywhere, and at any moment, 
and in any method the spirit will speak its need 
in the listening ear of God. Our fathers used to 
speak of and practice ejaculatory prayer. It 
would be a great gain to all of us if we could 
learn again the method and practice it. It is a 
great mistake to imagine that in the midst of 
London's busy traffic one has to wait for the ap- 
pointed place and hour and method. It is a 
great word in the " letter to the Hebrews " which 
declares that we " may find grace to help us in 
time of need." I have always felt that I should 
like to discover some idiom of my own language 
which would gather the thought of the Greek 
phrase, and I am not sure but that it is perfectly 
done by saying that the message declares we may 
find grace to help us " in the nick of time." The 
consciousness of this, however, can only be 
created as we are familiar with the secret place 
as a result of the set time and place and method. 

114 THE PEACTIOE OF PEAYER 

So far we have dealt with only the practice of 
prayer in the individual life, with the inner 
chamber and the shut door, the special place, the 
special time and the special method, and with 
prayer flung out in sighs and sentences in the 
rush of every-day activity, in the abiding con- 
sciousness of God's attention and God's answer. 
^ Turning to the habit of collective prayer, 
there is very much that might be said about the 
prayer-meeting. The prayer-meeting is a meet- 
ing for prayer. That is so obvious a statement 
as to appear unnecessary. Yet 1 do not hesitate 
to affirm that there is nothing the Church needs 
more at the present hour than to understand 
what a real prayer-meeting is. As we have 
already briefly said, the perfect ideal is set forth 
in the Master's words, " Where two or three are 
gathered together in My name, there am I in the 
midst of them." He was primarily declaring 
the ground upon which He had made His promise 
" If two of you shall agree on earth as touching 
anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for 
them." I am perfectly aware that these sacred 
words of our Lord open before our vision vaster 
reaches, and have more spacious meanings, but at 
the present time we consider them only in the 
first application which our Lord made of them. 
The first necessity then for the prayer-meeting is 
that those constituting it should be gathered " in 
His name." Two souls so gathered, each under 
His dominion â€” and the place is of no moment. 
The great word " where " is magnificent in its 

THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 115 

breadth; no longer in Jerusalem, no longer at 
the temple, no longer in a mountain set apart, no 
longer in a church or meeting-house or any other 
special place only, but " where," in the home, in 
the field, upon the sea, on the mountain, in the 
great cathedral, in the mission-hall, they are 
'* gathered in the Name." "We do not catch the 
thought if we say " two or three met together," 
" assembled together," no, they must be " gath- 
ered," and the great and only " Gatherer " is the 
Lord Himself, acting today through the Holy 
Spirit. Then they must be gathered " in His 
name," which does not merely mean that they 
must be called Christians, but they must be 
sharers of His nature, those who are living His 
life, under the impulse of His love, in the illu- 
mination of His light. When such souls are so 
gathered you have the prayer-meeting. A meet- 
ing for prayer is a meeting of two or three units, 
hundreds, thousands, gathered, as we have said, 
and who give themselves to prayer. I may be 
asked if I would discountenance singing and the 
exposition of scripture in prayer-meetings. "Well, 
I should certainly have no singing in a prayer- 
meeting, save the singing of some of the great 
prayer hymns of the Church, in which she is 
rich. I would have no other reading of the 
Word of God save perhaps some passage indicat- 
ing our responsibility in or re-stating the charter 
of prayer. In the true prayer-meeting there 
should be no " waiting." By that I do not mean 
that it is necessary always for some one to be en- 

116 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

gaging in audible prayer, but rather that the ces- 
sation of the sounding of a human voice ought 
not to mean the cessation of prayer. During all 
the silent pauses, every individual should be in 
silent communion with God, bearing up quietly 
some petitions which perhaps have already been 
decided upon or named in the assembly. Yet on 
the other hand there should be no " waiting " in 
the sense of refusing to lead in audible prayer 
when the Spirit guides. Elder waits for younger, 
younger waits for elder; the Spirit waits for all, 
and is grieved and hindered. In the true prayer- 
meeting there should be preeminently the con- 
sciousness that the saints are gathered not only 
" in His name," but because in His name, in His 
real presence. Where that is so there will be 
" waiting " only for direction by the Spirit. It 
may be objected that this kind of prayer-meeting 
would not be popular, yet surely it has not come 
to this that any Christian soul should imagine 
popularity to be the standard of success in the 
Church of God. 

This habit of collective prayer should not be 
confined to meetings merely in connection with 
the Church, that is, on the Church premises. It 
may be cultivated in the home-life, and indeed 
everywhere. As an illustration, let me suggest 
that Christian women should turn their faculty 
for social entertainment in this direction. Why 
not have '' At Homes " for prayer? At least, 
they would have the advantage of definiteness, 
and in that very minor sense would be infinitely 

THE PEAOTICE OF PEAYEE 117 

superior to many of the unhallowed crushes which 
characterize so-called social life today. Why not 
issue invitations upon this basis, that your friends 
should meet in your home to spend an afternoon 
in prayer. If the so-called friends would not 
accept the invitation, then surely you, as a 
Christian, are better without such friends. It is 
the Church's friendship with people who do not 
want to pray, which blights the Church and 
blights the world. The people in the ungodly 
suburb where your home is, may be, according to 
the canons of a worldly hour, preeminently re- 
spectable, but if they are not prepared to come to 
your home to talk with Christ, they are injuring 
you and you are injuring them by your continued 
friendship. Not only in the home life, but in all 
social intercourse, the saints should come together 
more for prayer. I go back in memory to the 
days when, as a lad at school in Cheltenham, I 
formed a friendship with one David Smith, a 
colporteur. His memory is fragrant still. On 
half-holidays I would accompany him to some of 
the villages lying among the Cotswold Hills. It 
was our custom, at his suggestion, to start half 
an hour earlier than was necessary to bring us in 
time for the meetings in order that on the way 
we might make a pause for prayer together. 
Some of the most hallowed memories of my heart 
today are of those meetings of two, one a young 
man loving his Lord, and the other a boy, open- 
ing his eyes towards the possibility of a life-work, 
pausing' at some stile amid the fields and agree- 

118 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

ing together to ask, asking and obtaining answers. 
The glory of such meetings lies in the utter ab- 
sence from them of constraint or compulsion of 
any kind other than that of the presiding Lord. 
In such a meeting one may pray as many times 
as the heart prompts. One may stop without 
elaborate finish, and commence again because in 
another's prayer a new desire has been born in 
one's own heart. I think we cannot tell how 
much it would mean to the strength of the 
Church if the saints of God cultivated the habit 
of fellowship in prayer in small groups. 

There are three notes of prevailing prayer of 
which I want to speak briefly. First, definite- 
ness, secondly, importunity, and thirdly, submis: 
sion. There is nothing we need more in personal 
prayer than to know what we want, and ask for 
it. It is possible to waste the great opportunity 
of prayer by indefiniteness. We may generalize 
prayer until we vapourize it, and there is no virtue 
left in it. It is a question whether ministers can 
serve their churches in any better way than by 
the simple habit of praying individually for the 
flock of God committed to their care. During 
the two years of my ministry at Westminster I 
have passed from North to South and East to 
West of my own country, and have twice visited 
the States. I have gone nowhere during that 
period without discovering the influence resulting 
from the ministry of the man of God who built 
that place, and more than thirty years ago passed 
on into the light of the Father's home. The 

THE PEAOTICE OF PEAYEE 119 

question arises as to what in the life and work of 
Samuel Martin created the influence which so 
long abides. He was an eloquent preacher, truly, 
and a man of saintly character, but perhaps the 
greatest thing about him was the fact of his 
definite praying. It was his habit to go into that 
great building when the doors were shut, and to 
pass from pew to pew praying for the people who 
occupied them at the regular services of the 
church. The same truth applies to our work in 
the Sunday-school. There is no more sacred, 
holy, or beautiful work than that of the teacher, 
no work that needs clearer vision or more tender 
heart. Our teachers will find great help from 
the practice of definite prayer for their children. 
Let them make the register of the scholar's names 
a prayer-book in the highest sense of that word. 
As every child in turn is born upon the heart, 
there will be created a new power for influencing 
those thus prayed for towards Christ Himself. 

All this is equally true of the collective praying 
of the saints. Prayer-meetings have too often 
been killed by aimless, rudderless, anchorless 
wanderings of such as seem to have no haven. It 
would be a habit of great helpfulness if before 
prayer the Church decided what it was about to 
pray for. It is impossible to pray about every- 
thing in one prayer-meeting. One day in a York- 
shire prayer-meeting there came a stranger who 
did what many men are in the habit of doing â€” 
God forgive them â€” he made a prayer. When he 
had been talking twenty minutes, and no living 

120 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

man ought to pray in a prayer-meeting above 
five, and had been giving the Almighty in- 
formation of which He had been in possession 
long before the man was born, at last he said, 
" And now, O Lord God, what more shall we say 
unto Thee? " An old man who knew how to 
pray audibly replied " Call Him ' Feyther,' mon, 
and ax for summat." This principle of definite- 
ness is what we supremely need in individual and 
collective praying. Jesus did not say, " If you 
will give God information for twenty minutes in 
elegant language you may derive some benefit 
therefrom." He said, " Ask, and receive "; " seek, 
and find "; "knock, and it shall be opened." 

The next note of prevailing prayer is that of 
importunity. In the eleventh and eighteenth 
chapters of Luke are two parables which show 
this necessity. The one is a picture of a man who 
obtained bread by knocking and by continuing 
to knock. The other is a picture of a woman who 
got redress for her wrongs by worrying a judge. 
Now Jesus was not teaching that God has to be 
begged in order to obtain His favor, not that 
He needs to be worried in order to persuade Him 
to do right, but rather that it is necessary for our 
sakes that there should be importunity. The man 
who asks and forgets does not really feel his need, 
and therefore will not receive. The man who 
knocks and runs away will never receive the 
beneficence of the One who alone can open the 
door. The men who know the real secret of 
prayer know| the meaning also of importunity. 

THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 121 

Epaphras agonized in prayer. There must be defi- 
niteness, and then importunity. 

But importunity must never degenerate into 
self-will. There must also be submission. Sub- 
mission as to the form in which the answer shall 
come; submission as to the method of the answer; 
submission as to the time of the answer. It must 
not be forgotten that we cannot see the end from 
the beginning, cannot understand the ultimate 
meaning of our own petitions, but we are praying 
to One who does see the end from the beginning, 
and who is perfectly conscious of the issue of our 
petitions. It may be that the things which to us 
seem most necessary would only prove a hindrance 
if they were granted. The best answer to such 
prayer is ever the kindly love which refuses. 
Therefore there must be submission in all pre- 
vailing prayer. 

Then as to the subjects of prayer. We are 
warranted in praying for anything which is 
within the sphere of the will of God. That state- 
ment is inclusive and exclusive. It includes 
everything which in itself is right, and which 
forms part of my life and service according to the 
Divine plan. It excludes everything which is 
wholly self-centered. There is no doubt that 
prayer in the Spirit will mean the cessation of a 
great many petitions. Many things after which 
we have most strenuously striven even in prayer, 
we shall be able to strive after no more if our life 
is responsive to all the facts which make prayer 
possible. Petitions will be fewer, but they will 

122 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 

be more powerful. One illustration of exclusion 
may be valuable, and yet in giving it let me first 
say that I am speaking from ray own experience 
only. There may be no application of this illus- 
tration to any other. We must all be perfectly 
persuaded in our own minds on such things. 
If we have faith we must have it to ourselves be- 
fore God. But to return. I cannot pray as I 
once did about the weather. Who am I that I 
should ask that any given day in the calendar 
should be fine? I am always profoundly thank- 
ful that although our friends across the ocean are 
able to send us w^eather forecasts, they do not 
send us weather. God still holds the government 
in His own hand. The mother of a friend of 
mine, a Baptist minister, told me why she had 
ceased praying concerning this matter. For many 
years at family worship she had been in the habit 
of asking for a fine day for the Sunday-school 
outing. When her boy was about ten years of 
age he came to her on one such morning and said, 
" Mother, I don't think you ought to ask God for 
a fine day. Perhaps it would be a great deal bet- 
ter for the farmers to have it wet, and why 
should it be fine just for our outing? " She re- 
plied that of course her petition was that if it 
should be God's will it might be fine. The boy 
then said, '' Why don't you ask God to help you 
to choose one of His fine days? " To me that is 
the whole philosophy of praying. It is not an 
arrangement by which we obtain things which 
we personally desire. It is rather the provision 

THE PEACTICE OF PEAYEE 123 

through which we seek to be brought into con- 
formity with the will of God, and to obtain only 
the light which enables us to walk therein. Not 
that it is wrong to ask definitely, but it is always 
wise to carefully weigh our petitions as to 
whether or not they really recognize His sover- 
eignty and wisdom. Charles Kingsley refused 
on one occasion to use the Archbishop's prayer 
for the cessation of rain. He recognized that the 
long downpour was sorely needed for sanitary 
conditions. 

There are particular things about which we 
ought to pray, for which we are commanded to 
pray; for all the saints, for the Word of God, for 
the Christian ministry, for all souls. 

Jesus prayed for all the saints in that great in- 
tercessory prayer. Paul prayed for these as the 
letters of the imprisonment testify. What a heal 
ing of our denominational differences would re- 
sult, if instead of perpetually discussing those 
differences we gave ourselves to prayer for each 
other. 

Then we should pray for the Word of God, 
that it " may run and be glorified." Again how 
much more powerful such action would be than 
that of debating our differing interpretations of 
its meaning. Then for the ministry. If the 
Church would pray for the ministry instead of 
criticizing it, there would be wonderful results. 
In this connection I should like to urge upon the 
Church that its special duty according to the 
teaching of the Lord is to pray that God will 

124 THE PEACTIOE OF PEAYEE 

thrust out into His harvest His own laborers. 
^ I am sometimes asked to appeal to young men to 
enter the ministry because there is a need of 
them. My answer is that no man can choose to 
become a minister â€” he must be sent. Therefore 
we should pray as our Master taught us that the 
Lord Himself will send. In this connection also, 
it may be well to urge the importance of pray- 
ing for those who have the sacred and awful 
charge of training men for the exercise of their 
ministry. Then moreover, we are to pray for 
the men who are exercising the holy calling. I 
once heard Dr. Berry give a charge to a young 
minister. In the course of that charge he said to 
the people, " You will get out of my young 
brother what you expect, and you will expect 
what you pray for." Then he used this homely 
but forceful illustration. Said he, "We were 
giving soup away lately to our poor people, and 
had issued general instructions that the lads who 
came to fetch the soup should bring with them a 
vessel that should hold about two quarts. I was 
at the soup-kitchen one day, and saw a boy about 
ten years of age, ragged and dirty, but with eyes 
that flashed fire, going into the soup-kitchen car- 
rying a vessel that would hold at least three gal- 
lons. We could not for shame put two quarts 
into that." "JSTow," said Dr. Berry, " when you 
come to hear your minister, do not bring a two- 
quart measure! " Oh, what it is to preach to men 
and women who have been praying for you. 
Then we are charged to pray for all souls, the 

THE PEACTIOE OF PRAYEE 125 

sorrowing, the sighing, the sad, the sinning. 
Moreover there is no small matter about which 
we have not the right to pray. Anna Shipton 
wrote a little book called Tell Jesus, being the 
memorials of Emily Goss. It is the story of a 
girl who told Jesus everything, from the trouble 
of a tangle in a skein of wool to the joys of the 
passing hours. 

From this sacred service of prayer no saint of 
God is excluded; the youngest and the weakest 
can pray. There are some of us who are ex- 
eluded from certain lines of service because of 
the pressure of life upon us, but no one of us is 
excluded from prayer. There are saints of God 
who for long, long years have been shut off from 
all the activities of the Church, and even from the 
worship of the sanctuary, but who, nevertheless, 
have continued to labor together in prayer with 
the whole fellowship of the saints. There comes 
to me the thought of one woman who, to my 
knowledge, since 18Y2 in this great babel of Lon- 
don, has been in perpetual pain, and yet in con- 
stant prayer. She is today a woman twisted 
and distorted by suffering, and yet exhaling the 
calm and strength of the secret of the Most 
High. In 18Y2 she was a bed-ridden girl in the 
ISTorth of London, praying that God would send 
revival to the Church of which she was a mem- 
ber, and yet into which even then she never came. 
She had read in the little paper called Bevival, 
which subsequently became The Christian, the 
story of a work being done in Chicago among 

126 THE PEACTICE OF.PEAYEE 

ragged children by a man called Moody. She 
had never seen Moody, but putting that little pa- 
per under her pillow, she began to pray, " O Lord, 
send this man to our Church.'* She had no means 
of reaching him or communicating with him. 
He had already visited the country in 1867, and 
in 1872 he started again for a short trip with no 
intention of doing any work. Mr. Lessey, how- 
ever, the pastor of the church of which this girl 
was a member, met him and asked him to preach 
for him. He consented, and after the evening 
service he asked those who would decide for 
Christ to rise, and hundreds did so. He was sur- 
prised, and imagined that his request had been 
misunderstood. He repeated it more clearly, and 
again the response was the same. Meetings were 
continued throughout the following ten days, and 
four hundred members were taken into the 
church. In telling me this story Moody said, " I 
wanted to know what this meant. I began 
making inquiries and never rested until I found 
a bed-ridden girl praying that God would bring 
me to that Church. He had heard her, and 
brought me over four thousand miles of land and 
sea in answer to her request." This story is told 
in the life of D. L. Moody by his son: but now 
let me continue it. That girl was a member of 
my church when I was pastor at ISTew Court. 
She is still a member, still suffering, still confined 
to her own room. When in 1901 I was leaving 
England for America I went to see her. She 
said to me, " I want you to reach that birthday 

THE PEAOTICB OF PEAYEE 127 

book." I did so and turning to February 5 I saw 
in the handwriting I knew so well, " D. L, Moody, 
Psalm 91P Then Marianne Adlard said to me, 
" He wrote that for me when he came to see me 
in 1872, and I prayed for him every day till he 
went home to God." Continuing, she said, " Now, 
will you write your name on your birthday page, 
and let me pray for you until either you or I go 
home." I shall never forget writing my name 
in that book. To me the room was full of the 
Presence. I have often thought of that hour in 
the rush of busy life, in the place of toil and 
strain, and even yet by God's good grace I know 
that Marianne Adlard is praying for me, and it is 
for this reason that to her in sincere love and ad- 
miration I have dedicated this book. These are 
the laborers of force in the fields of God. It 
is the heroes and heroines who are out of sight, 
and who labor in prayer, who make it possible 
for those who are in sight to do their work and 
win. The force of it to such as are called upon 
to exercise the ministry can never be measured. 
The personal word must again be forgiven. I 
never stand up in any assembly at home or 
abroad without knowing that three people nearer 
to me than any others will pray for me, my wife, 
my mother and my father. Oh, the power of it, 
and the humbling of it! It makes a man feel 
that he must be in line with such praying, and he 
is afraid, f Yet it makes him strong for he knows 
that " more things are wrought by prayer than 
this world dreams of." / Oh, for the multiplica- 

128 THE PEACTICE OF PEAYER 

tion of those who will devote themselves to this 
special labor of intercession. 

With all that we have attempted to consider 
in our minds, we lift our faces to the face of our 
Lord as did the men who watched Him pray in 
the olden days, and say to Him, " Lord, teach us 
to pray."
